Abstract This study investigated reading skills in 41
children with autism spectrum disorder. Four componentsof reading skill were assessed: word recognition, nonword
decoding, text reading accuracy and text comprehension.
Overall, levels of word and nonword reading and text
reading accuracy fell within average range although reading
comprehension was impaired. However, there was consid-erable variability across the sample with performance on
most tests ranging from ﬂoor to ceiling levels. Some chil-
dren read accurately but showed very poor comprehension,consistent with a hyperlexia reading proﬁle; some children
were poor at reading words and nonwords whereas others
were unable to decode nonwords, despite a reasonable levelof word reading skill. These ﬁndings demonstrate the het-
erogeneous nature of reading skills in children with ASD.

Introduction
Although there is a general assumption that reading is a
relative strength for children with autism spectrum disor-ders (ASD), systematic data concerning levels of reading
ability in this population are lacking. Two rather differentperspectives can be drawn from the existing literature.
First, it is well accepted that poor oral language skills place
children at high risk for literacy failure (e.g., Bishop &
Snowling, 2004 ; Catts & Kamhi, 2005), and since many
children with autism have language impairments (e.g.,Tager-Flusberg & Joseph, 2003 ), difﬁculty with learning to
read is to be expected. In contrast to this expectation,
numerous case studies describe exceptional levels ofreading skill in some children with autism (e.g., Turkeltaub
et al., 2004 ). Clearly however, one needs to be cautious
when generalising from single case studies, especially gi-ven the wide variation in cognitive and linguistic skills
seen in individuals with an ASD.
Reading is a complex skill and to read even a simple
sentence demands a number of skills ranging from rec-
ognising each individual word through to understanding the
intended meaning of a text. Broadly, Perfetti, Landi, andOakhill ( 2005 ) describe two major classes of processing
events that are necessary for successful reading compre-
hension: (1) the identiﬁcation of words and (2) theengagement of language processing mechanisms that
assemble words into messages. Together, ‘‘these processes
provide contextually appropriate word meanings, parseword strings into constituents, and provide inferential
integration of sentence information into more complete
representations of extended text.’’ (Perfetti et al., 2005 ,
p. 229). It is clear that successful reading comprehension
demands that both sets of processes operate adequately:
without adequate reading accuracy, reading comprehensionwill fail, and being able to read words accurately is no
guarantee that successful comprehension will follow. As
these two sets of processes can develop out-of-step(Hoover & Gough, 1990 ; Nation, 2005 ; Perfetti et al.,

assessing how well children with autism read.
Reading Accuracy and Autism
A number of studies highlight good reading accuracy skills
in both adults (Rumsey & Hamburger, 1990 ) and children
(Minshew, Goldstein, Taylor, & Siegel, 1994 ; O’Connor &
Hermelin, 1994 ; O’Connor & Klein, 2004 ) with autism,
and in some samples, reading accuracy is in excess of IQ-
expected levels (Mayes & Calhoun, 2003 ; Szatmari, Tuff,
Finlayson, & Bartolucci, 1990 ).
Frith and Snowling ( 1983 ) investigated aspects of
reading accuracy in a group of nine children with autism,relative to a group of normally-developing children mat-
ched for reading level. One question they addressed con-
cerned the strategies children with autism used to readwords. They reasoned that rather than decoding or deci-
phering words using a phonological ‘sounding-out’ strat-
egy, children with autism may capitalise on rotememorisation and recognise words on the basis of shape or
pattern recognition. To test this idea, Frith and Snowling
asked children to read aloud nonwords. As nonwords needto be decoded on the basis of letter-sound associations, if
children with autism read by relying heavily on visual
strategies, nonword reading should be compromised.However, children with autism were indistinguishable from
control children in terms of nonword reading. This suggests
that they were as skilled as normally-developing childrenof equivalent reading level at using phonological-based
reading strategies.
A limitation of these studies is that they only included
children who were reading at a reasonably advanced level.
For example, Minshew et al. ( 1994 ) recruited high-
functioning children, and the mean verbal IQ of theirsample was 97. Frith and Snowling’s study selection crite-
ria demanded that all participants had essentially
age-appropriate reading skills, according to a standardisedtest. Thus, these studies permit few conclusions to be made
concerning levels of reading accuracy competence across a
population of children with an ASD. In line with this cau-tion, descriptions of individuals with ASD point to con-
siderable variability in levels of word and nonword reading
accuracy (for review see Nation, 1999 ). As noted above, it is
difﬁcult to generalise from single case data and as different
researchers measure reading ability in different ways,comparison across studies is also difﬁcult. Nevertheless, a
number of case descriptions indicate that some children with
ASD are very poor at reading nonwords, despite the fact thatthey are relatively skilled at reading words (Aaron, Fantz, &
Manges, 1990 ; Goldberg & Rothermel, 1984 ). This suggests
that for some autistic children at least, reading accuracy maynot be underpinned by adequate phonological decodingskills, as is the case in normal reading development (e.g.,
Goswami & Bryant, 1990 ).
Reading Comprehension and Autism
Turning to the other component of reading ability, there is
broad agreement that children with autism have impaired
reading comprehension, an observation ﬁrst made byKanner ( 1943 , reprinted in Kanner, 1973, p. 42) in his
original description of autism: ‘‘the children read monot-
onously, and a story ... is experienced in unrelated portionsrather than its coherent totality’’. Despite the high-
functioning nature of the sample recruited by Minshew
et al. ( 1994 ), levels of reading comprehension were sig-
niﬁcantly lower in the children with autism relative to
IQ-matched controls. Consistent with this, the children in
Frith and Snowling’s study performed less well than con-trols on a test of reading comprehension, despite the fact
that the two groups of children were well-matched in terms
of reading accuracy.
This proﬁle of impaired reading comprehension but
well-developed word recognition skills is consistent with
the pattern of reading behaviour seen in hyperlexia, theterm given to children who, despite pronounced cognitive
and linguistic deﬁcits, show remarkably advanced word
recognition skills (Grigorenko, Klin, & Volkmar, 2003 ;
Nation, 1999 ). Such apparently well-developed reading
skills are usually only superﬁcial. Reading accuracy is
well-developed and precocious but reading comprehensionis severely impaired. Although it is clear that a hyperlexic-
like reading pattern may occur in non-autistic children
(Nation, Clarke, & Snowling, 2002 ; Snowling & Frith,
1986 ), there is a strong association between autism and
hyperlexia. Many children who have a hyperlexic reading
proﬁle are autistic, or show features of autism (e.g., Gri-gorenko et al., 2002 ). It is not clear why this is the case
but Nation ( 1999 ) speculated that a number of factors may
be important: a particular pattern of cognitive and lin-guistic strengths and weaknesses, a tendency to be inter-
ested in local features rather than global coherence, and a
preoccupation with text and reading. As these featurestend to cluster together in people with autism, patterns of
hyperlexic reading are therefore more common in this
group.
In summary, there is evidence that some children with
autism can read accurately, but even amongst these chil-dren, levels of reading comprehension are poor (Frith &
Snowling, 1983 ; Minshew et al., 1994 ; O’Connor & Klein,
2004 ; Snowling & Frith, 1986 ). Thus, it is tempting to
conclude that many children with autism are hyperlexic,
especially given the observation that many children with
hyperlexia are autistic, or show features of autism(Grigorenko et al., 2002 ; Nation, 1999 ). However, it is912 J Autism Dev Disord (2006) 36:911–919
123difﬁcult to generalise studies reporting good levels of
reading accuracy in children with autism as samples were
selected on the basis of cognitive ability or reading ability.Excluding children with poor language and literacy may
result in an overestimation of levels of reading accuracy in
children with autism. Given the severe oral languageimpairments that characterise many children with autism
(Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg, 2001 ; Lord & Paul, 1997 ;
Tager-Flusberg & Joseph, 2003 ), and the close relation-
ship between oral language impairment and difﬁculties
with learning to read (Bishop & Snowling, 2004; Catts &
Kamhi, 2005; Nation, Clarke, Marshall, & Durand, 2004 ),
poor reading in at least some children with an ASD is to
be expected. By using standardised tests that assess dif-
ferent aspects of reading, the present study investigated arange of reading skills in a population of children with
ASD. The following questions and predictions were
explored:
1. What is the level of reading ability in a relatively large
and relatively broad population of children with ASD?
Based on the literature reviewed above, and given the
heterogeneous nature of ASD, we anticipated consid-erable variation in levels of reading ability in our
sample.
2. What are the levels of component reading skill
(accuracy and comprehension)? There is clear evi-
dence that reading comprehension is often impaired in
children with ASD and therefore we anticipateddepressed levels of reading comprehension in our
sample. Given the association between poor reading
comprehension and oral language comprehension (e.g.,Nation et al., 2004 ), we predicted that children with
poor reading comprehension would show concomitant
weaknesses in aspects of oral language.
3. Do discrepancies between (relatively strong) reading
accuracy and (relatively weak) reading comprehension
characterise the reading proﬁle of children with ASD?Children described as hyperlexic are often autistic, or
show autistic features (e.g., Grigorenko et al., 2002 ;
Nation, 1999 ). By examining discrepancies between
accuracy and comprehension in our sample, we aimed
to explore the extent to which a ‘hyerplexic’ proﬁle
typiﬁes patterns of reading behaviour in children withASD.
4. Finally, we investigated levels of nonword reading in
our sample. Some case reports suggest that somechildren with ASD show unexpected difﬁculties with
decoding novel words (e.g., Aaron et al., 1990 ;
Goldberg & Rothermel, 1984 ). We examined the ex-
tent to which nonword reading deﬁcits characterise the
pattern of reading skills seen in a relatively large
population of children with ASD.Method
Participants
Children were recruited from a Child and Adolescent
Mental Health Clinic serving the City of York and sur-
rounding areas. To explore patterns of reading in as general
a sample as possible, we imposed only two selection cri-teria. Chronological age was the ﬁrst criterion. In the UK,
children begin formal literacy instruction before their 5th
birthday, and by 6 years, reading skills are becoming rea-sonably well established in the normal population. We
therefore recruited children from 6 years upwards. An
upper limit of 15 years was chosen. Our second selectioncriterion was that language skills were sufﬁcient enough to
allow them to participate in our study. No formal criterion
was employed. Instead, clinicians were asked to referchildren they considered to have ‘‘measurable language
skills, however minimal’’. On the basis of these criteria, 68
families of children with an autism spectrum disorder agedbetween 6 and 15 years of age were sent an information
sheet about the study and invited to take part. Forty fam-
ilies agreed to take part; one family had two children withautism, making a total of 41 children (36 boys and 5 girls).
The mean age of the sample was 10.33 years.
The children varied as to their particular diagnosis on
the autistic spectrum. Diagnoses had been made by expe-
rienced clinicians using research diagnostic criteria in a
multidisciplinary diagnostic forum, according to ICD-10(World Health Organization, 1993 ) criteria. Sixteen chil-
dren fulﬁlled criteria for autism (including one child with
Fragile-X syndrome), 13 for atypical autism and 12 forAsperger’s syndrome. This relatively high proportion of
children with Asperger’s syndrome probably reﬂects our
request that minimal language skills be in place.
Materials and Procedure
Children were tested in their homes or in a quiet room in
their schools. The tests were presented in a single sessionlasting approximately 1.5 h. Rest periods were allowed as
required.
We made four assessments of reading, three tapping
aspects of reading accuracy and one tapping reading
comprehension.
Reading Accuracy
The ﬁrst measure of reading accuracy was decoding,
measured by a nonword reading test, The Graded Nonword
Reading Test (Snowling, Stothard, & McLean,
1996 ). This
provides a relatively pure measure of decoding as children
need to apply letter-sound rules in order to read aloud itemsJ Autism Dev Disord (2006) 36:911–919 913
123they have never seen before. The nonword reading test
comprises 10 one-syllable and 10 two-syllable nonwords
and is standardised on a UK sample.1Our second measure
of reading accuracy tapped word recognition and was as-
sessed using the reading subtest of the British Ability
Scales (BAS-II; Elliot, Smith, & McCulloch, 1996 ), an
untimed test in which children read aloud single words
presented one-at-a-time out of context. Our third measure
of reading accuracy assessed how well children read con-nected text. This was assessed using the Neale Analysis of
Reading Ability-II (NARA-II; Neale, 1997 ). This test re-
quires children to read aloud short passages of text. Thenumber of errors they make is noted and used to form a
reading accuracy score.
Reading Comprehension
The NARA-II also provided a measure of reading compre-
hension. After reading each passage, children were asked
questions to assess their understanding of what they had read.Some of the questions tapped literal understanding of the
passage, whereas others required an inference to be made.
Oral Language Skills
Two measures of oral language skill were made. Receptive
vocabulary was assessed using the British Picture Vocab-
ulary Scale-II (BPVS-II; Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley,
1997 ). Children are presented with four pictures and asked
to point to the picture which represents a word spoken
aloud by the tester. The comprehension subtest from theWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III
UK;
Wechsler, 1992 ) provided a measure of oral language
comprehension. This test requires children to understandlanguage in the absence of concrete or pictorial context; it
also requires them to use world knowledge, an important
requirement for establishing reference and understandingintended meaning (e.g., Milosky, 1990 ).
Nonverbal Ability
The Block Design subtest from the WISC-III
UKprovided
an estimate of nonverbal ability.Results
Levels of Reading SkillNine children were completely unable to read. These were
amongst the youngest in the sample (mean age 7.28 years;
mean age for the remaining sample was 10.85 years) andincluded six children with autism (4 boys and 2 girls), and
three with atypical autism (3 boys). These children were
excluded from further analyses. Table 1summarises the
performance of the remaining 32 children on tests of
reading, language and nonverbal ability. Note that some
children performed below the ﬂoor of standard scores onsome of the tests. To be conservative, a score one point
below the standardisation ﬂoor was awarded (for example,
the NARA-II standard score ﬂoor is 70; children failing toattain this level of performance were awarded a standard
score of 69). Mean standard scores for the three measures
of reading accuracy (word reading, text reading and non-word reading) were within normal range. In contrast,
reading comprehension was, on average, about 1SD below
population norms. However, it is important to note theextreme variability within the sample: as is clear from the
range of scores shown in Table 1, performance on these
measures of reading—and indeed most of the tests in thebattery—varied from ﬂoor to ceiling levels (range infor-
mation for each test is also provided in Table 1).
Component Reading SkillsTo investigate patterns of reading performance in more
detail, our next set of analyses examined four component
reading skills, namely the ability to read aloud single wordspresented out of context, the ability to decode nonwords,
the ability to read connected text accurately and the ability
to comprehend text. Table 2shows the correlation between
these four components of reading skill. Although the tests
inter-correlated at a statistically signiﬁcant level, the cor-
relations were fairly modest in size and were smaller thanthose observed in samples of typically-developing children.
To illustrate, correlations taken from Nation and Snow-
ling’s ( 1997 ) study of 184 7–11 year old children are
shown in parentheses in Table 2. Fisher exact tests were
used to investigate whether the size of each correlation was
signiﬁcantly greater in the normative sample compared tothe children with ASD. The correlations between word
reading and text reading ( z= 2.37), word reading and
comprehension ( z= 2.84), nonword reading and text
reading ( z= 2.96), nonword reading and comprehension
(z= 1.96), and text reading and comprehension ( z= 3.11)
were all signiﬁcantly larger in the normative sample than inthe ASD group; the difference in magnitude of the corre-
lation between word reading and nonword reading between

of 653 children aged between 5 and 11 years. The test manual reportsage equivalents and centile scores, but not standard scores. Followingthe procedures of Briscoe, Bishop and Norbury ( 2001 ), data from the
standardisation sample were transformed to form standard scores
which were then used to quantify the performance of children in thepresent study. Standard scores for the older children in the presentstudy (aged 14 and 15 years) were obtained from a group of 50 15-
year old typically-developing adolescents reported by Snowling,
Bishop, and Stothard ( 2000 ). Consistent with Snowling et al., the test
was made more difﬁcult for the older children by adding ﬁve non-words ( strumbesh, delathode, tralishent, grikimest, pragendent ).914 J Autism Dev Disord (2006) 36:911–919
123the two groups did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
(z= 1.44). Taken together, these observations suggest that
in children with ASD, component reading skills have atendency to develop out of step with each other.
Deﬁcits in Reading Comprehension
Sixty-ﬁve percent of our sample showed poor reading
comprehension, as deﬁned as standard scores at least 1SD
below population norms, and 38 %scored more than 2SDs
below population norms (i.e., standard scores of 70 andbelow, the ﬂoor of the test). However, it would be wrong to
consider all of these children as hyperlexic as many
showed concomitant difﬁculties with reading accuracy.The relationship between word reading and reading com-
prehension is shown in Fig. 1. Cases below the line indi-
cate children for whom reading comprehension was poor,relative to word reading ability. Particularly striking are
those cases falling towards the bottom right quadrant of the
scatterplot. Despite high levels of word reading ability,reading comprehension was very poor. Thus, these children
showed poor reading comprehension despite achieving a
satisfactory level of word reading.
Of the 32 children with measurable reading ability, 20
achieved word-reading levels in the normal range or above
(i.e., a standard score above 85). Ten of these children alsohad reading comprehension within the normal range or
above, whereas 10 showed impaired reading comprehen-sion (i.e., below 85). Table 3summarises the performance
of these two subgroups of skilled and less-skilled com-
prehenders on the various measures of reading and lan-guage. The two groups were similar in age and nonverbal
ability, and not surprisingly, the two groups did not differ
on any of the measures of reading accuracy. Interestinglyhowever, the less-skilled comprehenders showed impair-
ments in vocabulary, and in oral language comprehension,
relative to the skilled comprehenders. Thus, impairments inreading comprehension are accompanied by weakness in
oral language skills in this group of children. Consistent
with this group comparison, across the entire sample therewas a strong correlation between reading comprehension
and vocabulary ( r= 0.72, P< .01) and oral language
comprehension ( r= 0.67, P< .01).
Discrepancies between Reading Accuracy and Reading
Comprehension
The NARA-II provides a useful tool for assessing the
extent to which children with ASD show deﬁcits in reading
comprehension, relative to the level expected on the basis
of text reading accuracy. As illustrated in Table 2, theTable 1 Performance of

123correlation between accuracy and comprehension was
signiﬁcant ( r= 0.568, P< .05) but substantially lower
than the correlation seen in Nation and Snowling’s ( 1997 )
normative study ( r= 0.87, P< .01; Fisher’s exact
z= 3.11, P< .01). In addition, the majority of our group
of children with ASD showed a discrepancy betweenreading comprehension and reading accuracy and for some
children the gap between the two sets of skills was sub-
stantial. Of the 32 children with measurable reading skills,10.3%achieved a comprehension score that was in excess
of 2 SDs below their accuracy score (a gap greater than 30
standard score points; mean difference = 49.3 standardscore points, range 46–52). A further 24.12 %obtained a
comprehension score 1–2 SDs below their level of reading
accuracy (mean difference = 19.85 standard score points,
range 16–26). Although the majority of the sample
(65.5%) achieved comprehension and accuracy scores
within 1SD of each other, it is worth noting that even for
these children, comprehension scores were lower than
accuracy scores (mean difference = 5.84 standard scorepoints, range 0–14). Only one child showed the reverse
pattern obtaining a comprehension score three points in
excess of his reading accuracy score. Thus, these obser-vations suggest that difﬁculties with reading comprehen-
sion are not uncommon in children with ASD and that for
approximately 35 %of the population of children who can
read single words at a reasonable level, reading compre-
hension is at least 1SD below text reading accuracy levels.
Unfortunately, the NARA-II manual does not provide
information concerning the frequency or magnitude of
accuracy-comprehension discrepancies in the standardisa-
tion sample. However, we were able to address this issueusing normative data from 562 normally-developing chil-
dren aged between 7 and 12 years (Nation & Snowling,
unpublished data). This representative sample achieved amean accuracy standard score of 98.22 ( SD12.03), a
mean comprehension score of 94.09 ( SD10.70), and thecorrelation between accuracy and comprehension was
0.718. Consistent with this high correlation, the majority of
children in the sample (88.6 %) achieved a comprehension
score within 1SD of their accuracy score. A further 10.9 %
obtained a comprehension score 1–2 SDs lower than their
accuracy score (compared to 24.12 %in the ASD group);
only 0.5%of the sample obtained a comprehension score
more than 2SDs below their accuracy scores (compared to
10.3%in the ASD group). Finally, in sharp contrast to the
sample with ASD where only one child showed the reverse
pattern of accuracy scores in advance of comprehension,
36.8%of the normative sample showed this reading
proﬁle.
Deﬁcits in Decoding
Although problems with reading comprehension charac-
terised the majority of children in the group, it is worth
noting that many of the children were poor at decodingnonwords. Of the sample of 32 children who were able to
read words at all, 42 %were at least 1SD below population
norms for nonword reading and 22 %of the sample scored
at least 2SD below population norms. As noted above, in
the normal population, the correlation between word and
nonword reading is high (for example, Nation & Snowling(1997 ) reported a correlation of 0.83; Snowling et al.
(1996 ) reported a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.78 between
nonword reading and word recognition; Torgesen, Wagner,& Rashotte ( 1999 ) reported correlation coefﬁcients
between 0.78 and 0.80 between these two variables). The
correlation of .69 between word and nonword reading in
our sample of children (shown in Fig. 2) suggests that word
recognition (word reading) and phonological decoding
(nonword reading) are not so tightly linked in this group.Perhaps most striking are those children who, despite
adequate levels of word reading, were poor at decoding
nonwords. While these children were low in number (toTable 3 Comparison of performance on measures of reading, language and nonverbal ability for children with skilled vs. less-skilled reading

Discussion
This study permits a number of conclusions to be made
concerning levels of reading ability in children with ASD.
Of those families agreeing to take part in our study, 78 %of
children had measurable reading abilities in that they were
able to read aloud single-words presented out of context.
As a whole, the group showed normal-range levels ofreading accuracy, but reading comprehension was lower.
However, there was considerable variation within the
group such that performance on all of the reading testsvaried from near ﬂoor to near ceiling. Thus, group means
are relatively uninformative when considering component
reading skills in this group of children.
As anticipated, a large proportion of children showed
impaired reading comprehension: 65 %of the sample
obtained reading comprehension at least 1SD below popu-lation norms, and about one-third of the sample showed
very severe reading comprehension impairments. For some
of these children, problems with reading comprehension
may well have stemmed from inadequate reading accuracy:
if children are unable to recognise or decode the words in atext, it is not surprising that they are unable to understand its
meaning. However, of the 20 children who achieved normal
range word reading skills, 10 showed poor reading com-prehension. For these children, their poor comprehension
could not be attributed to deﬁcits in word- or text-level
reading accuracy. Compared with children with normal-range reading comprehension skill, these children showed
impairments in vocabulary and oral language comprehen-
sion, suggesting that impairments in reading comprehensionaccompany impairments in understanding language more
generally (Bishop & Adams, 1990 ; Nation et al., 2004 ).
Given the high proportion of children with autism who
experience difﬁculty with reading comprehension (despite
possessing adequate levels of decoding ability), an
important direction for future work is to pinpoint whichaspects of the reading comprehension process are impaired.
This is a vital ﬁrst step if appropriate and well-targeted
interventions are to be put in place. Comprehension isclearly a very complex process which may fail for a
number of different reasons. O’Connor and Klein ( 2004 )
highlighted a number of aspects of the comprehensionprocess that may be particularly problematic for people
with autism: for example, a general difﬁculty with inte-
grating information, difﬁculty understanding and resolvinganaphoric reference, a difﬁculty with bringing prior
knowledge to bear when reading text (see also Wahlberg &
Magliano, 2004 ) and difﬁculties with comprehension
monitoring. Encouragingly, O’Connor and Klein
(2004 ) also reported data indicating that reading compre-
hension was facilitated in their sample of high-functioningstudents with ASDs when the experimenter focussed on an
aspect of the comprehension process, for example, direct-
ing attention to the anaphoric link between a pronounand its antecedent in a text. While it remains to be seen
whether ﬁndings from such experimental manipulations
can translate to a classroom situation when a child isworking independently, O’Connor and Klein’s study
illustrates the importance of considering the underlying
reasons why children with autism are poor at readingcomprehension.
Although 32/41 of our sample had measurable word
reading skills and as a group, the children showed aver-age-for-age word reading ability, it is interesting to note
that many children struggled to decipher nonwords. At
ﬁrst glance, this ﬁnding is surprising. Nonwords aremeaningless strings of letters that need to be decoded
using letter-sound correspondence rules; one might antic-
ipate that this skill should be a relative strength for chil-
dren with autism. Indeed, Minshew et al. ( 1994 ) found that
nonword reading was relatively better than word readingin their sample of high-functioning children with autism.
Generally, our data demonstrate rather low levels of
nonword reading ability, and for some individuals, non-word reading skills were considerably below the level
expected given their level of word reading ability. This
may reﬂect the fact that our sample was not selected onthe basis of either reading ability (cf. Frith & Snowling,
1983 ) or IQ (cf. Minshew et al., 1994 ). Our observations
suggest one of two things. First, it could be that someWord Reading160 140 120 100 80 60 40Nonword Reading130

123children with autism have difﬁculty applying phonological
decoding strategies. Numerous ﬁndings point to a rela-
tionship between difﬁculties in the phonological domainand poor nonword reading (e.g., Bishop, Adams, &
Norbury, 2004 ; Rack, Snowling, & Olson, 1992 ). Difﬁ-
culties with oral language are not rare in populations ofchildren with ASD and according to Tager-Flusberg and
colleagues (Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg, 2001 ; Tager-
Flusberg & Joseph, 2003 ) approximately 50 %of children
with ASD show language deﬁcits, including impairments
in phonological processing (as indexed by poor nonword
repetition for example). Potentially therefore, impairmentsin oral language may underlie the difﬁculties that some
children in our sample had with poor nonword reading.
Unfortunately however, we did not measure phonologicalprocessing but a reasonable prediction would be that those
children with poorest phonological skills would show
greatest difﬁculty with nonword reading. Alternatively (oradditionally), the relative advantage of word reading over
nonword reading observed in our study may be attribut-
able to some children utilising rote memorisation or visualassociation strategies when reading. Clearly, such a
strategy would assist word reading, but not nonword
reading. Potentially, this pattern of reading may beencouraged or confounded by literacy instruction. Our
anecdotal experience suggests that for some children with
autism, reading instruction is more focussed on the onrepetition of familiar materials rather than more phonic-
based reading strategies.
The high levels of poor reading comprehension seen in
this study are consistent with the view that hyperlexia is
associated with autism (e.g., Grigorenko et al., 2002 ).
Unfortunately however, the deﬁnition of hyperlexia remainsunclear (Grigorenko et al., 2003 ; Nation, 1999 ). While the
central feature of hyperlexia is word reading accuracy skills
in advance of reading comprehension, several other featureshave been described including an unusual preoccupation
with reading, very early (and sometimes spontaneous) onset
of word recognition and a general mismatch between pro-ﬁcient reading accuracy on the one hand and the presence of
cognitive and social deﬁcits on the other. Grigorenko et al.
(2003 ) recommended that the term hyperlexia be reserved
for those individuals with pervasive developmental disorder
who show all of these features of hyperlexia. They alsorecommended that the term ‘‘reading comprehension dis-
order’’ be adopted to describe those individuals (including
non-autistic children) who show a discrepancy betweenreading accuracy and reading comprehension, but do not
show the other features of hyperlexia. It is important for
future work to establish the validity of this view by com-paring children who show ‘hyperlexic reading’ but do or do
not show additional features such as unusual preoccupation
or early onset of reading ability. Only if there are signiﬁcantdifferences between the two groups will it become impor-
tant to make the distinction recommended by Grigorenko
et al. ( 2003 ). Until this issue is resolved and the deﬁnition of
hyperlexia clariﬁed, it is premature to estimate the inci-
dence of hyperlexia in our sample, especially as data
concerning preoccupation with reading and onset of readingare limited. Nevertheless, it is clear that poor reading
comprehension characterised the majority of children, and a
sizeable proportion showed poor reading comprehensiondespite achieving adequate levels of reading accuracy.
Our data serve to highlight that reading is not a unitary
construct and that component skills may dissociate in casesof developmental disorder. In our sample of children, we
identiﬁed children with poor reading comprehension and
children with poor nonword reading, relative to wordreading ability. This observation offers a cautionary note
for the assessment of reading in this population. Put sim-
ply, reliance on tests of word recognition is likely to over-estimate children’s reading competence in other areas,
most notably reading comprehension skills, but for some
children, decoding ability too. Very clearly, good or evenprecocious word reading ability does not guarantee ade-
quate reading comprehension. While it is clear that aspects
of reading may be a relative strength in some children withASD, and may even serve as a tool for educational inter-
vention (e.g., Williams, Wright, Callaghan, & Coughlan,
2002 ), it is important for both research and practice that the
heterogeneous pattern of reading skills in children with
autism is recognised.
