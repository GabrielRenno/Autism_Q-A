Ann Saudi Med 30(4) July-August 2010 www.saudiannals.net 295Autism is one of a group of neurodevelopmental 
disorders known as pervasive developmental 
disorders (PDD). These disorders are charac -
terized by three core deficits: impaired communication, 
impaired reciprocal social interaction and restricted, 
repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors or in -
terests. The presentation of these impairments is vari -
able in range and severity and often changes with the 
acquisition of other developmental skills. 
In 1943, the American psychiatrist Leo Kanner used 
the term “early infantile autism” to describe children who 
lacked interest in other people.1 In 1944, an Austrian 
pediatrician, Hans Asperger, independently described 
another group of children with similar behaviors, but 
with milder severity and higher intellectual abilities. 
Since then, his name has become attached to a higher 
functioning form of autism, Asperger syndrome.2 It 
was not until the 1980s that the term pervasive devel -
opmental disorders was first used. 
The definition and diagnosis of these disor -
ders has been broadened over the years to include 
milder forms of autism. The term autism spectrum 
disorders (ASDs) is currently used to describe 
three of the five pervasive developmental disorders 
listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and Autism spectrum disorders

Pervasive developmental disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by im -
pairments in communication, reciprocal social interaction and restricted repetitive behaviors or inter -
ests. The term autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been used to describe their variable presentation. 
Although the cause of these disorders is not yet known, studies strongly suggest a genetic basis with a 
complex mode of inheritance. More research is needed to explore environmental factors that could be 
contributing to the cause of these disorders. The occurrence of ASD has been increasing worldwide, 
with the most recent prevalence studies indicating that they are present in 6 per 1000 children. The 
objectives of this article are to provide physicians with relevant information needed to identify and refer 
children presenting with symptoms suggestive of ASDs to specialized centers early, and to make them 
feel comfortable in dealing with public concerns regarding controversial issues about the etiology and 
management of these disorders.

Edition (ICD-10): autistic disorder, Asperger disor -

A diagnosis of autistic disorder is made when 
there are impairments in communication and recip -
rocal social interaction with the presence of restricted 
repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors or 
interests, prior to the age of 3 years. When autistic 
symptoms are present with no significant general 
delay in language and cognitive development, a di -
agnosis of Asperger disorder is made. A diagnosis 
of PDD-NOS is given when the triad of symptoms 
is present but the criteria are not met for a specific 
PDD.3 Often the label “high-functioning autism” is 
used interchangeably with Asperger disorder.5 This 
is controversial and there is considerable debate as to 
whether children with Asperger disorder, who have 
normal language milestones, should be considered to 
comprise a subgroup distinct from high-functioning 
children with autism, who have a history of delayed 
language development.6 The other two PDD’s, Rett 
syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, are 
rare and are associated with significant developmental 
regression, which makes them more distinct than the 
other disorders in the PDD group.3 review AUTISM

ASD occurs more often in boys than girls, with a 4:1 
male-to-female ratio.7 The reported prevalence rates of 
autism and its related disorders have been increasing 
worldwide over the past decades, from approximately 
4 per 10 000 to 6 per 1000 children.8-12 The reasons for 
this increase include wider public awareness of these 
disorders, broadening of the diagnostic concepts, reclas -
sifications of disorders and improved detection.7,13 The 
possibility that the increase in the reported cases is a 
result of unidentified risk factor(s) cannot be ruled out, 
and therefore more research is needed to address this. 
Etiology 
The exact cause of autism and the other ASDs is still 
not known. The etiologic theories have changed over 
the years. It was once thought to be the result of faulty 
child-rearing. This historical psychosocial theory has 
been rejected, as research clearly indicates that the eti -
ology is multi-factorial with a strong genetic basis.14 
Although the etiology is not clear, there are a minority 
of cases, less than 10%, where autism is part of another 
condition. Such cases are often referred to as “second -
ary” autism; these include tuberous sclerosis, fragile X 
syndrome, phenylketonuria and congenital infections 
secondary to rubella and cytomegalovirus.14-20 
Genetic factors 
Family studies have demonstrated that autism is both 
familial and heritable. The recurrence rate in siblings 
of an autistic child is 2% to 8%, which is higher than 
that of the general population.8,17 Furthermore, twin 
studies showed that monozygotic twins have a high -
er concordance rate than dizygotic twins—90% and 
10%, respectively.14,15,17 Other genetic studies suggest 
a complex mode of inheritance, with linkage studies 
suggesting genetic loci on several chromosomes in -
cluding chromosome 717 and  chromosome X.15 
Environmental factors 
Various environmental factors have been explored as 
possible causative agents in autism. Epidemiological studies indicate that some environmental factors, in -
cluding prenatal infections with rubella and cytomeg -
alovirus, account for few cases of autism.17 The role of 
heavy metals in the etiology of autism is controversial 
and requires more research.21 
There are public concerns about vaccines being 
possible triggers for autism. There have been two 
separate hypothesis relating vaccination to autism, 
the first is the potential adverse effect of the measle, 
mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and the second is 
that of thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used 
in some vaccines. These two hypotheses are distinct 
from each other; MMR vaccines have never con -
tained thimerosal, because it would inactivate a live 
vaccine.7 
Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the ASD 
hypothesis 
An article published in 1998 suggested a possible re -
lationship between the MMR vaccine and ASD. Since 
then, there has been a decline in the rate of MMR 
vaccination among children.22,23 As a consequence of 
that, there have been measles outbreaks.23 These fac -
tors led to the conduction of large worldwide studies 
to examine this potential relationship. These studies 
showed that there is no association between MMR 
vaccine and ASDs.24-29 The measles vaccine has been 
proven to be safe and effective in preventing this po -
tentially lethal disease. Therefore, with the lack of sci -
entific evidence that MMR vaccine is causally related 
to autism, the administration of MMR vaccine should 
be encouraged to prevent measles outbreak. 
Thimerosal and the ASD hypothesis 
Thimerosal is a mercury-containing compound that 
has been used as an additive to vaccines to prevent bac -
terial contamination. In 1997, the United States Food 
and Drug Administration called for assessment of the 
risk of all mercury-containing foods and drugs. This 
action stimulated the United States Public Health 
Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics to 
issue a joint statement in 1999 calling for the removal 
of thimerosal from the vaccines. This action was un -
dertaken as a precautionary measure. There was no 
evidence that mercury was harmful at the doses be -
ing administered in the vaccines.30 The evidence from 
these studies does not support and favors rejection of 
a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing 
vaccines and autism.28,31-34 Further evidence contra -
dicting this hypothesis is that rates of autism have 
continued to increase despite the removal of thimero -
sal from vaccines in 1999.7,33 Table 1 . The five pervasive developmental disorders.

Physicians play an important role in early recognition of 
ASD, because they are usually the first point of contact 
for parents. Therefore, it is important that physicians be 
able to recognize the various signs and symptoms of this 
group of disorders.35 Physicians should be alerted to 
the possibility of autism and its related disorders when 
there are qualitative impairments in social, language and 
communication skills, as well as repetitive interests and 
behaviors. The severity of these impairments varies sig -
nificantly among children with ASD. Even though the 
typical age of onset is before 3 years, the impairments 
can be subtle and may not be detected before school age. 
An example of this are children with Asperger disorder, 
who may be identified and diagnosed much later than 
children with typical autism, on average at 11 years of 
age.5 This is because parents of children with Asperger 
disorder may not recognize the subtle abnormalities in 
their child’s behavior, because they may not have an op -
portunity to compare them to peers. Conversely, physi -
cians and teachers compare a child’s behavior to typi -
cally developing children and notice abnormalities and 
impairments more easily.5 This reflects the importance 
of gathering information about the child from multiple 
sources, especially when diagnosing the broader perva -
sive developmental disorders.5,36 
The diagnosis is challenging in children at the both 
ends of the spectrum. Children with severe autistic 
symptoms may be hard to differentiate from those with 
isolated severe intellectual disability, while those with 
mild symptoms may be misdiagnosed as having a lan -
guage disorder or a social anxiety. T able 2 lists some of 
the general developmental warnings of possible ASD in 
children and adolescents. 
Several structured instruments have been used for 
screening for ASDs in high-risk children, e.g. siblings 
of autistic children, children with developmental de -
lay or genetic syndromes. The Checklist for Autism in 
T oddlers (CHAT), Modified-Checklist for Autism in 
T oddlers (M-CHAT), Childhood Autism Rating Scale 
(CARS) and Social Responsiveness Scale-Parent and 
T eacher (SRS), are some of the widely used instruments 
for screening these high-risk children.37-40 Although 
these are well-structured instruments, they should be 
used with caution as they are screening tests and should 
not be used to rule out or confirm the diagnosis. 
The diagnosis of ASD is best achieved by a team of 
health care professionals who are well informed and ex -
perienced in these disorders. Therefore, a primary care 
health worker should refer any child suspected of hav -
ing ASD to a specialist team for detailed assessment. 
The specialist team makes the diagnosis of ASD based on an autism-specific history and clinical observation. 
Specific tools commonly used in the assessment include 
the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) 
and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule 
(ADOS).41-43 
Most children with ASDs have a normal physical 
examination. The physical examination should include 
observations of any dysmorphic features or skin pig -
mentations along with a detailed neurological examina -
tion that may be suggestive of secondary causes, such 
as fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis. Currently, 
there are no laboratory or radiologic tests to diagnose 
ASD. The diagnostic yield from biomedical investiga -
tions is low.44 Most guidelines and practice parameters 
on ASD recommend conducting DNA analysis for frag -
ile X syndrome, regular karyotyping, audiology testing 
and other investigations where clinically relevant.45,46 
The yield of an etiologic investigation may be increased 
with the presence of coexisting developmental delay or 
intellectual disability.8 
Treatment 
ASDs are lifelong chronic disabilities. At present, there 
is no cure for the core symptoms of autism. However, 
several groups of medications, including atypical neu -
roleptics, have been used to treat associated behavioral 
problems such as aggression and self-injurious behav -
iors.47,48 
Research has shown that the most effective therapy 
is use of early intensive behavioral interventions that 
aim to improve the functioning of the affected child. 
These interventions focus on developing language, 
social responsiveness, imitation skills, and appropri -
ate behaviors. Examples of these behavioral thera -
pies include ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) and 
TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and 
Related Communication Handicapped Children). The 
ABA approach involves teaching new behaviors by ex -
plicit reinforcement; problem behaviors are addressed 
by analyzing triggers in order to change factors in the 
environment that are contributing to that behavior.49 
The TEACCH approach takes advantage of relative 
strengths in visual information processing using strate -
gies such as visual schedules, clearly structured and or -
ganized classrooms, and highly structured learning ac -
tivities that are broken down into manageable, visually 
organized steps.49 These behavioral techniques should 
begin early in the pre-school period and be followed by 
highly individualized educational intervention in the 
school.50-54 
Since conventional medicine has failed to find a cure 
for ASD, families have been seeking complementary review AUTISM

clude the use of mega-vitamins and other nutritional 
supplements, chelation therapy and hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy. Currently, there is no evidence to support the 
use of nutritional supplements as an intervention for 
ASD.21,55,56 There have been claims that diets free of 
casein and/or gluten are effective interventions for 
autism. The latest Cochrane review in 2008 reported 
lack of evidence to support the use of these diets for 
children with ASD, and stated that there is a lack of re -
search on the potential harms and disbenefits of these 
diets.56 Therefore, families who desire to try these di -
ets should be counseled on the need for calcium and 
vitamin D supplements with attention to the protein 
intake, since milk and dairy products represent major 
sources of calcium and protein intake for these young 
children. 
Despite the lack of scientific evidence, desperate 
and vulnerable parents seek chelation therapy for their 
affected children in an attempt to remove heavy metals 
that are thought to cause autism.57 The use of chela -
tion therapy in children with autism and its related 
disorders has not been validated. Furthermore, it is an 
invasive procedure and can have fatal consequences.57 
Recently, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has increased in 
popularity as an alternative therapy for ASDs.58 This therapy involves inhaling up to 100% oxygen in a pres -
surized chamber to increase plasma oxygen to the tis -
sues including the brain.58,59 Because of the limited 
research in this field, conclusions about the efficacy of 
hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a treatment for children 
with ASDs cannot be drawn at this time.58-60 
Conclusion 
ASDs are a group of disorders characterized by im -
pairments in three domains, namely communication, 
reciprocal social interaction and behaviors that are 
restricted and repetitive in nature. Physicians play a 
crucial role in the early identification of children with 
these disorders since they are the first point of con -
tact and the starting point for referral to appropriate 
centers for further evaluation and management. These 
disorders are increasing in prevalence, so that physi -
cians are more likely to encounter them during their 
practice. Therefore, physicians need to be aware of 
the variable presentation of these disorders in order 
to identify affected children early and refer them ap -
propriately to specialized centers for evaluation, coun -
seling and intervention. Furthermore, physicians need 
to feel comfortable in dealing with public concerns 
regarding controversial issues about the etiology and 
management of these disorders.
