Abstract  
 
Introduction.  The use of horses in therapy h as a fairly long history.  There are many refe r-
ences to the therapeutic benefits of this activity.  Such therapies have been underg oing a boom 
internationally in recent years. However scientific research into the effective use of this acti v-
ity in children with autism is still in the early stages of development.  
Method.  The impact of a therapeutic horse -riding program on a set of psychosocial var iables 
in a group of 8 autism spectrum disorder subjects of 7 to 16 years in age is evaluated.  The 
study design w as quasi -experimental, test -retest, with two groups – experimental and control.  
The measurement instruments were the "Behavior Assessment System for Children" (BASC), 
and a quality -of-life questionnaire based on a standard model used in mental health cont exts. 
The treatment program comprised twenty -four 45 -minute sessions.  
Results.   The results show significant differences in some of the quality -of-life indicators and 
there were lower levels of aggressiv eness (BASC).  
Discusion and c onclusion s. The horse ri ding is particularly well matched to the specific 
characteristics of persons with autism, since it is based on an individual activity but at the 
same time brings into play multiple interactions in a context which is more structured and less 
chaotic than ot her team sports.  
 
Keywords: Autism, behavior assessment, quality -of-life, therapeutic horse -riding, adapted

Resumen  
Introducción . El uso de caballos en la terapia tiene una historia bastante larga. Hay m uchas 
referencias acerca de los beneficios terapéuticos de esta actividad. Estas terapia s han exper i-
mentado un auge a nivel internacional en los últimos años. Sin embargo , la investigación 
científica sobre el uso efectivo de esta actividad en los niños con autismo se encuentra todavía 
en las pr imeras etapas de desarrollo.  
Método.  Se evalúa el  impacto de un programa de equitación terapéutica en un conjunto de 
variables psicosociales en un grupo de 16 sujetos con trastorno del espectro autista de 7 a 14 
años de edad. El diseño del estudio fue cuasi -experimental, test -retest, con  grupo experime n-
tal y gr upo de control. Los instrumentos de medición fueron el "Sistema de Evaluación de la 
Conducta Infantil" (BASC) y un cuestionario de calidad de vida basado en un modelo está n-
dar que se utiliza en los contextos de salud mental. El programa de tratamie nto comprende 
veinticuatro s esiones de 45 minutos.  
Resultados.  Los resultados mostraron diferencias significativas en algunos de los indicad ores 
de calidad de vida y niveles más bajos de agresividad  en la batería (BASC).  
Discusión y conclusiones . La equit ación es una actividad que se adapta particularme nte bien 
a las características específicas de las personas con autismo, ya que se basa en una act ividad 
individual, pero al mismo tiempo pone en juego múltiples interacciones en un conte xto que es 
más estruc turado y menos caótico que otros deportes de equipo.

The classical concept of autism has changed greatly since the original descriptions by 
Kanner (1943).  Given the variability in cognitive impairment and social communication, t o-
day one speaks of a continuum rather than a specific diagnostic category , and it is ever co m-
moner to use the term Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD's) coined by Wing & Gould (1979). 
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Ps y-
chiatric Association , 2002), Autistic Disorder is classifie d as a subgroup of Pervasive Deve l-
opmental Disorders, together with Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Aspe r-
ger's Disorder, and Pervasive D evelopmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.  The new 
classi fication proposal of DSM -5 (American P sychiatric Association, 2013 ) categorizes  these 
disorders (except for Rett's Disorder because of its clear genetic identification and unique pa t-
tern of symptoms) as Neurodevelopmental Disorders, under which there is a single category 
termed Autism Spectrum  Disorders.  This new category condenses the three key symptoms 
(qualitative social interaction impairment, qualitative communication impairment, and r e-
stricted patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities) into two (persistent deficits in comm u-
nicatio n and social interaction, and restricted patterns of behaviour, interests, and a ctivities), 
and allows for three levels of involvement to be established according to the intensity of su p-
port required.  
 
Despite all the advances in neuroscience and genetic m ethods, it has still not been po s-
sible to establish a model explaining the ætiology and pathophysiology of ASD, although it is 
presumed that the basis is genetic and that epigenetic and environmental factors are involved 
(Mulas et al., 2010).  Current studi es show that ASD's are far commoner than previously 
thought.  Indeed, the recognized prevalence has gone from one case of autism per 2500 chi l-
dren twenty -five years ago to one in 88 children today (data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Preve ntion, 2012).  The reason is that current figures cover the entire spectrum, 
including the mil dest, highly functional, cases.  
 
With no defined biological markers for ASD, diagnosis is made by observing the b e-
haviour of the person, analysing their developmental hi story, and applying a battery of med i-
cal and psychological tests for the presence of signs and symptoms of autism.  These include 
structured systems of information acquisition such as the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating 
Scale: Schopler et al., 1988), ADI -R (Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised: Lord, Rutter & Effects of a Program of Adapted Therapeutic Horse -riding in a Group of Autism Spectrum Disorder Children  
Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32                          - 111- 
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 Le Couteur, 1994), and ADOS -G (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: Lord et al., 
1989) which have given diagnostic classification greater reliability.  
 
A recent report by an independent research cent re and funded by the U.S. gover n-
ment's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reviews 159 studies, and notes 
that treatments for ASD children can be classified into four categories (see the full report in 
Warren et al., 2011).  Each category com prises treatments aimed at alleviating a specific set 
of symptoms and behaviours.  They are: (I) programs of behaviour and development; (II) pr o-
grams of education and learning; (III) medication; and (IV) other treatments and therapies.  
Because any given A SD child may present different types of symptoms, the family may have 
to choose between the available treatments, therapies, and programs in accordance with the 
child's needs.  Indeed, the plan for a given child may include some aspect of each of the four 
categories of treatment.  Warren et al. (2011) place equestrian therapies in their fourth cat e-
gory of "other trea tments and therapies".  It is interesting that the work of Bass, Duchowny & 
Llabre (2009) was the first work on such therapies to be included in  a rigorous scientific r e-
view such as that of Warren et al. (2011).  
 
The use of horses in therapy has a fairly long history (Saywell, 1988).  As we shall d e-
tail below, there are many references to the therapeutic benefits of this activity.  While scie n-
tific research into the effective use of this activity in children with autism is still in the early 
stages of development, such therapies have been undergoing a boom internationally in recent 
years.  There are a rapidly growing number of horse -riding centres which devote part of their 
activity to therapies with different groups, including persons with autism.  Although, as noted 
above, the scientific evidence is still far from definitive, the literature seems to indicate that 
therapeutic horse -riding and horse  handling have a positive impact on the development of 
communication and social interaction of persons with autism and other neurodevelopmental 
disorders (Francis, 2003; Leitão, 2004; Lercari & Rivero, 2006; Bass, Duchowny & Llabre, 
2009; Ward et al., 2013 ), increase adaptive behaviour and motivation (Taylor et al., 2009), 
favourably affect motor skills (Freire, 2000; Wuang et al., 2010), help improve quality -of-life 
(Kern et al., 2011; Walter & Hesse, 2006), reduce maladaptive behaviours while providing 
significant improvements in adaptive skills (Cincinnati Therapeutic Horse -Riding and H., 
2006; Gabriels et al., 2009, 2012), lower the levels of cortisol and increase those of oxytocin 
(Tabares et al., 2012), and even improve some of the symptoms of the diso rder itself (Van den 
Hout, 2010; Kern et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2013). Those studies, however, investigated just Andrés García -Gómez et al.

use evalu ation tools that would allow one to make  an overall assessment, as would have been 
the case if they had applied a multidimensional instrument such as the BASC battery of Re y-
nolds & Kamphaus (1992).

Regardless of the possible therapeutic effects of the interaction with horses for persons  
with ASD, horse -riding is emerging as a suitable activity for children and adults with autism.  
Participation in sports and leisure activities is an essential element of any program targeted at 
improving people's quality -of-life (Schalock & Verdugo, 2002) .  As Rubio & García -Gómez 
(2011) show, horse -riding as a sport and leisure activity is an alternative that particularly fits Effects of a Program of Adapted Therapeutic Horse -riding in a Group of Autism Spectrum Disorder Children  
Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32                          - 113- 
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 the characteristics of persons with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD).  In essence, there are three reaso ns.  One is that, while done individually, multiple 
interactions come into play in a form that is more clearly structured than in other sports done 
in groups. Another is that it is primarily based on epidermal and tactile communication with 
the animal, as well as, although to a lesser extent, on verbal communication (which is usually 
altered in persons with autism). And the third is that it is done in a natural outdoor enviro n-
ment, something that is highly motivational.  
 
Physical exercise is good for everyo ne's health. But it is especially important for chi l-
dren with autism because their social, communicative, and motivational difficulties cause 
them to have lower levels of physical activity than the general population.  They therefore run 
the risk of additi onal disorders associated with this relative inactivity (Pan & Frey, 2006; Pan, 
2008; Kleinhans, 2010).  Although these studies have failed to provide completely definitive 
evidence (Sowa & Meulenbroek, 2012), it does seem that sport provides persons with ASD 
the opportunity of improving voluntary motor balance and movement, and their social and 
cognitive competences, of gaining confidence in their sporting activities, of reducing the 
emergence of stereotyped behaviours, and to some extent of relieving co -morbidities (Reid, 
2005; Szot, 1997; Rosenthal -Malek & Mitchell, 1997; Elliott et al., 1994; Keyes, 2009; 
Yanardağ, Yılmaz, & Aras, 2010).  
 
Aims  
Therefore, the intention with the present work was to try to ascertain the social and 
behavioural effects of a p rogram of initiation to horse -riding and of therapeutic horse -riding 
in a group of ASD pupils.  The variables to consider related to the subjects' adaptive capacity 
measured with the BASC battery of tests (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992) and to their quality -
of-life. 
 
Method  
 
Participants  
The sample consisted of 32 pupils diagnosed with ASD, attending mainstream schools 
in the Provinces of Cáceres and Badajoz, Spain. However, there is only enough information 
about 16. Two groups were formed: 8 pupils in the expe rimental group, and 8 in the control 
group. Their characteristics were:  Ages 7 to 14 years. 13 pupils lived in the City of Cáceres Andrés García -Gómez et al.  
 
- 114 -                      Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32   
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  and 3 lived in other towns in the Province, all in urban settings of Cáceres, Plasencia, and 
Trujillo  (Spain ). IQ > 50: two subjects in the range 50/70, and the rest with > 90. CARS 
scores: mean 31 (mild autism). No subject had had contact with horses during the two years 
prior to participating in the program, and only one had previously participated in horse -riding 
activities.  Conventional treatment, both medical and re -education, were maintained u n-
changed throug hout the program.  
 
Gender: 3 girls, 13 boys, for a ratio of 1:4 . The equivalent prevalence ratio for the 
general population is approximately 1:4 (Rodríguez -Barrionuevo  & Rodríguez -Vives, 2002).  
 
The sampling method was of convenience, since random sampling was unfeasible due 
to the dispersion of potential subjects.  
 
Instruments  
The dependent variables were  the social, affective, and emotional variables : adaptive 
skills,  social skills, leadership, withdrawal, anxiety, depression, behavioural problems, 
atypicality, aggressiveness, hyperactivity, attention problems, and somatization. They were 
measured through the multidimensional BASC -T (for Teachers) test battery  (Reynold s & 
Kamphaus, 1992).  This has five components that evaluate the subject from different 
perspectives and which can be used individually or in any combination. They are: a self -
report on personality; a structured developmental history; a pupil observation sy stem; and two 
assessment questionnaires, one for  parents (P) and one for teachers  (T), designed to collect 
information on the behaviour of the child or adolescent in different contexts.  We used the 
teacher rating form (T)  in the present study.  Reliability  of the global dimension of the BASC 
ranged from .77 to .91.  
 
Dependent variables related to  quality -of-life: measured  through an ad hoc parent 
questionnaire based on the Quality -of-Life Model  of Schalock & Verdugo (2002).  To elab o-
rate and validate the in strument, we used a procedure of consensus via inter -rater valid ation 
with a group of experts in the treatment of pupils with special educational needs.  The result 
was a 7 -item questionnaire yielding indicators of the following dimensions: emotional well -
being, interpe rsonal relationships, personal development, physical well -being, self -
determination, social i nclusion, and familial well -being.  The reliability indicator (Cro nbach's 
alpha) was acceptable (. 641).

http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 Intervention program  
The three -month interve ntion program consisted of twice -weekly sessions (a total of 
24 sessions) of three -quarters of an hour each, with groups of 4 pupils.  The practical sessions 
in which the pupils of the experimental group participated were held in the Monfragüe Eque s-
trian C entre of Cáceres, which has over fifteen years experience of training young riders in its 
Riding School. Each session consisted of three phases forming a continuum of the central ri d-
ing activity.  This pattern was based on that used by Bass, Duchowny & Lla bre (2009) which 
was designed and implemented by instructors with PATH International (Professional Associ a-
tion of Therapeutic Horsemanship International, formerly NARHA) training.  The first phase 
corresponded to activities prior to mounting – preparing th e equipment and the horse.  The 
second phase corresponded to mounting and riding.  In the first sessions, each pupil was 
helped by a monitor leading the horse with a halter.  The third phase corresponded to learning 
to round off the work with the horse, to  dismount, bring in the horse, gather and put away the 
equipment, and say goodbye to the horses and to the monitors.   
 
Because of the cognitive and behavioural characteristics of ASD children, some ada p-
tations were made to fit the riding activity to their particular educational needs. These were 
based on the work of Horvat, Németh & Gal (2003), Brown (1996), Rivière (1998), Hodgdon 
(1995), and Schopler, Mesibov & Hearsey (1995).  Essentially, they were: inciting the su b-
jects to do the program's activities b y assuming a lightly intrusive attitude; using highly stru c-
tured teac hing based on errorless learning; and using environmental visual structuring cues.  
 
 The educational objectives of the intervention were based primarily on the document 
“The regulations o f the official rating program for riders of the Spanish Equestrian Feder a-
tion”, in particular, in the content related to levels 1 and 2 of the gallop.  This text is available 
in “Curso de Equitación. Galopes. Niveles 1 al 4”, published in 2008 by Ediciones  Tutor S.A.  
The detailed information about the programme appears Rubio & García -Gómez (2011) and 
García -Gómez et al. (2012).  
 
Procedure  
Firstly, contacts with the parents from two Autism associations were established. They 
were invited to take part and wri tten permissions were requested for that participation in the 
programme. In addition, parents were asked to bring the necessary details for this study. Andrés García -Gómez et al.  
 
- 116 -                      Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32   
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  Thereafter, the insurance and the medical reports for the practice of horse riding were also 
requested.  
 
Before the start of these sessions of contact with a horse, two informative meetings 
were held with the monitors in which an autism specialist informed them of the subjects' basic 
characteristics, what their needs are, and what aspects are to be taken int o account when inte r-
acting with them.  Similarly, another two informative meetings were held in which the mon i-
tors i nformed the parents and other collaborators in the sessions about the basic characteristics 
of handling horses and what preventive practices  should be followed at all times. After these 
initial informative meetings, the program sessions themselves were initiated.  
 
Moreover, the collaborators of this study asked the teachers of these children to fill in 
the BASC questionnaire before and after t he treatment programme.  
 
Design and data analysis  
As noted above, the objective of this work was to examine the effects of a therapeutic 
horse -riding program (independent variable) on a group of personal, social, and emotional 
variables of pupils with ASD (dependent variables).  The design was to use a pre -test and 
post-test with an experimental and a control group.  The impossibility of forming the groups 
at random imposes a certain limit on the validity of its results.  In the classification termino l-
ogy o f Montero & León (2007), the design is a sub -class of quasi -experimental studies d e-
noted "quasi -control".  
 
 Nonparametric statistics were used for hypothesis testing since the samples were very 
small.  The significance level for intergroup differences was taken to be . 05.  Descriptive st a-
tistics were calculated for the appropriate variables.  
 
Results  
 
The presentation of the results will correspond to the impact of the therapeutic horse -
riding program on: a set of psychosocial variables as evaluated with th e BASC questionnaire 
and the quality -of-life as evaluated by an instrument based on the model of Schalock & Ve r-
dugo (2002).

BASC questionnaire  
The data from the que stionnaires completed by the teachers (BASC -T), as shown in 
Table 2, showed significant differences in the variable aggressiveness   p = .039; d = 0.220. In  
the initial assessment (test) to the experimental group, the mean score for the aggressiv eness 
varia ble was 4. 6 and af ter treatment (retest) it was 3. 33. It also highlights the score for hype r-
activity p = .077; d= 0.549. 
 
Suffice it to say that the values for the variable "atypicality" in the experimental group 
(p = .066; d = 0.392) are close to signific ance but in the control group also observed that 
maturation effect ( p = .063; d = 0.64).

 Consulting in Cohen's tabl es (1988) we obtain a power < 0. 25 for a sample of n = 8. 
Ist a very low statistical power, therefore this sample could only detect effect sizes d ≥ 0.70. 
Therefore there is a hi gh probability of making Type II  errors . So we included Cohen's d va l-
ues for consulting the effect size, the effect size is a solid statistic.  
 
Effects of the therapeutic horse -riding program on quality -of-life 
The questionn aire to assess the quality -of-life was completed by the parents of both 
groups (experimental and control) after completion of the intervention program.  The Mann -
Whitney test (Table 4) revealed significant differences in favour of the experimental group in  
the dimensions "Interpersonal relations" and "Social inclusion", although these specific i m-
provements were insufficient for there to be a significant difference in the total quality -of-life 
score (p = .086).

Discussion  and conclusions  
 
The socio -emotional variables evaluated by the BASC are to some extent  more d e-
pendent on the context than are the constituent variables of autism, and are therefore more 
influenced by intervention programs.  But we noted above that, of all the variables analysed in 
this survey, significant differences were only found in aggr essiveness ( p = .039).  
 
Some of the works consulted in our literature review refer to significant changes in 
some of the variables studied in the BASC. They did not use the same evaluation instrument 
however.  Leitão (2004) refers to improvements in behavi our and social interaction; the work 
of Cincinnati Therapeutic Horse -Riding & Horsemanship (2006) reports improvements in 
adapted behaviour; Bass, Duchowny & Llabre (2009), Kern et al. (2011) and Ward et al. 
(2013) refer to significant improvements in inte ractive competences; and Gabriels et al. 
(2012) report significant reductions in challenging behaviour.  In contrast, as noted above, our 
data show significant differences only in aggressiveness.  
 
The possible influence of the therapeutic horse -riding prog ram on the subjects' aggre s-
sive behaviour can be explained as being due to the relaxing effect even of passive physical 
activity (Von -Knorring et al., 2008).  The inability to control behaviour is a possible explan a-
tion of the nature of the restricted and repetitive behaviours of persons with ASD, and the or i-
gin of this executive dysfunction may be a deficit in frontal lobe functioning.  In this sense, 
Anderson -Hanley, Tureck & Schneiderman (2011) indicate that improving executive control Andrés García -Gómez et al.  
 
- 120 -                      Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32   
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  functions in perso ns with ASD together with the direct benefits of exercise may help them 
achieve greater behavioural control.  
 
There is a growing scientific literature demonstrating the psycho -physiological i m-
provements resulting from moderate intensity exercise in persons  with ASD, such as with the 
experimental subjects of the present study.  Sowa & Meulenbroek (2012) list the benefits that 
have been reported in the various studies in the literature on the effect of sporting activities on 
persons with ASD: constituting an opportunity for social integration; reduction in stereotyped 
behaviours; improving motor performance and physical capacities in general; fostering self -
determination and thereby improving their quality -of-life; improving cognitive skills and ac a-
demic perfo rmance; reducing stress; and improving social skills.  The work of Tabares et al. 
(2012) also lends a certain support to our data in that it finds reduced cortisol levels, increased 
progesterone levels, and therefore increased oxytocin levels in a group of  ASD individuals 
following sessions of hippotherapy.  This change in hormonal status favours, among other 
things, the modulation of aggressive behaviour.  
 
The last group of variables analysed were related to the quality -of-life.  Previous work 
has found th erapeutic horse -riding programs to improve the quality -of-life of persons with 
ASD (Kern et al., 2011).  Walter & Hesse (2006) also report improvements in the quality -of-
life of patients with psychiatric disorders (both neuroses and psychoses).  Our data s howed 
the experimental group pupils to obtain better indicators of quality -of-life than the control 
group pupils in two of the dimensions analysed – interpersonal relations and social inclusion.  
 
For an explanation, one must take into account the behaviour al characteristics of pe r-
sons with ASD.  Yanardağ, Yılmaz & Aras (2010) note that ASD children usually do not play 
with their peers or participate in physical and sports activities because of their difficulties in 
integrating and communicating with their c lassmates, their repetitive behaviours, restricted 
interests, and, in many cases, inferior motor performance.  Hence, giving them the opport u-
nity to participate in a leisure or sport physical activity such as horse -riding contributes d i-
rectly to improving their quality -of-life. 
 
By way of synthesis, we can say that the present study provides a vision that is co m-
plementary to foregoing work (Table 1 summarizes the literature consulted), and is the first to Effects of a Program of Adapted Therapeutic Horse -riding in a Group of Autism Spectrum Disorder Children  
Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32                          - 121- 
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 contribute information on  the impact of therapeutic  horse -riding  on a comprehensive set of 
psychosocial skills evaluated with an instrument as complete as the BASC questionnaire.  
 
The therapeutic horse -riding program described in this work has involved a group of 
subjects with ASD in a range of sports and  leisure activities in which they have learned to 
handle horses and other aspects of horsemanship. This activity is particularly well matched to 
the specific characteristics of persons with autism, since it is based on an individual activity 
but at the sam e time brings into play multiple interactions in a context which is more stru c-
tured and less chaotic than other team sports.  Its essence is communication that is tactile and 
epidermal with the animal rather than verbal (which is usually altered in persons  with ASD), 
and it is performed in a highly motivating natural environment.  Thus, horse -riding, with the 
necessary adjustments to adapt it to this group of persons, is a sports and leisure activity that 
can well form part of the repertoire of activities s uggested for persons with ASD.  
 
Limitations  
Clear limitations of the present study need to be taken into account in interpreting the 
results in the sense that the improvements observed may have been due to other uncontrolled 
variables.  The quasi -experimen tal nature of the study design, with the control group not b e-
ing selected totally at random, may have influenced the results. The study sample was very 
small and in no way representative, so that it is not possible to generalize the findings to a la r-
ger po pulation. Also, the heterogeneity of the sample, with the diversity of profiles, to a ce r-
tain extent conditioned how the intervention sessions were carried out, and thus may have d i-
luted the effects of the treatment. And finally, the benefits can not be gu aranteed to be perm a-
nent since the study did not include a longitudinal type of design.  
 
These limitations are to some extent common to most of the works consulted on this 
topic, and could serve as a referent for the improved experimental design of new con tribu-
tions.  
 
Future research  
Finally we would note that, further effort is needed to allow greater control of the 
variables involved, with more strictly controlled designs, larger samples, longitudinal studies 
to evaluate the duration of any benefits, stud ies on samples with differing degrees of severity 
of the syndrome, and studies allowing variation in the intensity, duration, and frequency of Andrés García -Gómez et al.

http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  the sessions.  Also, one needs to determine the physical and psychological mechanisms and 
processes that are put into play in horse -riding that would explain its therapeutic benefits for 
persons with autism.
