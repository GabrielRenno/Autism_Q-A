Abstract  
 
Introduction.  The use of horses in therapy h as a fairly long history.  There are many refe r-
ences to the therapeutic benefits of this activity.  Such therapies have been underg oing a boom 
internationally in recent years. However scientific research into the effective use of this acti v-
ity in children with autism is still in the early stages of development.  
Method.  The impact of a therapeutic horse -riding program on a set of psychosocial var iables 
in a group of 8 autism spectrum disorder subjects of 7 to 16 years in age is evaluated.  The 
study design w as quasi -experimental, test -retest, with two groups – experimental and control.  
The measurement instruments were the "Behavior Assessment System for Children" (BASC), 
and a quality -of-life questionnaire based on a standard model used in mental health cont exts. 
The treatment program comprised twenty -four 45 -minute sessions.  
Results.   The results show significant differences in some of the quality -of-life indicators and 
there were lower levels of aggressiv eness (BASC).  
Discusion and c onclusion s. The horse ri ding is particularly well matched to the specific 
characteristics of persons with autism, since it is based on an individual activity but at the 
same time brings into play multiple interactions in a context which is more structured and less 
chaotic than ot her team sports.  
 
Keywords: Autism, behavior assessment, quality -of-life, therapeutic horse -riding, adapted

Resumen  
Introducción . El uso de caballos en la terapia tiene una historia bastante larga. Hay m uchas 
referencias acerca de los beneficios terapéuticos de esta actividad. Estas terapia s han exper i-
mentado un auge a nivel internacional en los últimos años. Sin embargo , la investigación 
científica sobre el uso efectivo de esta actividad en los niños con autismo se encuentra todavía 
en las pr imeras etapas de desarrollo.  
Método.  Se evalúa el  impacto de un programa de equitación terapéutica en un conjunto de 
variables psicosociales en un grupo de 16 sujetos con trastorno del espectro autista de 7 a 14 
años de edad. El diseño del estudio fue cuasi -experimental, test -retest, con  grupo experime n-
tal y gr upo de control. Los instrumentos de medición fueron el "Sistema de Evaluación de la 
Conducta Infantil" (BASC) y un cuestionario de calidad de vida basado en un modelo está n-
dar que se utiliza en los contextos de salud mental. El programa de tratamie nto comprende 
veinticuatro s esiones de 45 minutos.  
Resultados.  Los resultados mostraron diferencias significativas en algunos de los indicad ores 
de calidad de vida y niveles más bajos de agresividad  en la batería (BASC).  
Discusión y conclusiones . La equit ación es una actividad que se adapta particularme nte bien 
a las características específicas de las personas con autismo, ya que se basa en una act ividad 
individual, pero al mismo tiempo pone en juego múltiples interacciones en un conte xto que es 
más estruc turado y menos caótico que otros deportes de equipo.

The classical concept of autism has changed greatly since the original descriptions by 
Kanner (1943).  Given the variability in cognitive impairment and social communication, t o-
day one speaks of a continuum rather than a specific diagnostic category , and it is ever co m-
moner to use the term Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD's) coined by Wing & Gould (1979). 
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Ps y-
chiatric Association , 2002), Autistic Disorder is classifie d as a subgroup of Pervasive Deve l-
opmental Disorders, together with Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Aspe r-
ger's Disorder, and Pervasive D evelopmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.  The new 
classi fication proposal of DSM -5 (American P sychiatric Association, 2013 ) categorizes  these 
disorders (except for Rett's Disorder because of its clear genetic identification and unique pa t-
tern of symptoms) as Neurodevelopmental Disorders, under which there is a single category 
termed Autism Spectrum  Disorders.  This new category condenses the three key symptoms 
(qualitative social interaction impairment, qualitative communication impairment, and r e-
stricted patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities) into two (persistent deficits in comm u-
nicatio n and social interaction, and restricted patterns of behaviour, interests, and a ctivities), 
and allows for three levels of involvement to be established according to the intensity of su p-
port required.  
 
Despite all the advances in neuroscience and genetic m ethods, it has still not been po s-
sible to establish a model explaining the ætiology and pathophysiology of ASD, although it is 
presumed that the basis is genetic and that epigenetic and environmental factors are involved 
(Mulas et al., 2010).  Current studi es show that ASD's are far commoner than previously 
thought.  Indeed, the recognized prevalence has gone from one case of autism per 2500 chi l-
dren twenty -five years ago to one in 88 children today (data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Preve ntion, 2012).  The reason is that current figures cover the entire spectrum, 
including the mil dest, highly functional, cases.  
 
With no defined biological markers for ASD, diagnosis is made by observing the b e-
haviour of the person, analysing their developmental hi story, and applying a battery of med i-
cal and psychological tests for the presence of signs and symptoms of autism.  These include 
structured systems of information acquisition such as the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating 
Scale: Schopler et al., 1988), ADI -R (Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised: Lord, Rutter & Effects of a Program of Adapted Therapeutic Horse -riding in a Group of Autism Spectrum Disorder Children  
Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32                          - 111- 
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 Le Couteur, 1994), and ADOS -G (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: Lord et al., 
1989) which have given diagnostic classification greater reliability.  
 
A recent report by an independent research cent re and funded by the U.S. gover n-
ment's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reviews 159 studies, and notes 
that treatments for ASD children can be classified into four categories (see the full report in 
Warren et al., 2011).  Each category com prises treatments aimed at alleviating a specific set 
of symptoms and behaviours.  They are: (I) programs of behaviour and development; (II) pr o-
grams of education and learning; (III) medication; and (IV) other treatments and therapies.  
Because any given A SD child may present different types of symptoms, the family may have 
to choose between the available treatments, therapies, and programs in accordance with the 
child's needs.  Indeed, the plan for a given child may include some aspect of each of the four 
categories of treatment.  Warren et al. (2011) place equestrian therapies in their fourth cat e-
gory of "other trea tments and therapies".  It is interesting that the work of Bass, Duchowny & 
Llabre (2009) was the first work on such therapies to be included in  a rigorous scientific r e-
view such as that of Warren et al. (2011).  
 
The use of horses in therapy has a fairly long history (Saywell, 1988).  As we shall d e-
tail below, there are many references to the therapeutic benefits of this activity.  While scie n-
tific research into the effective use of this activity in children with autism is still in the early 
stages of development, such therapies have been undergoing a boom internationally in recent 
years.  There are a rapidly growing number of horse -riding centres which devote part of their 
activity to therapies with different groups, including persons with autism.  Although, as noted 
above, the scientific evidence is still far from definitive, the literature seems to indicate that 
therapeutic horse -riding and horse  handling have a positive impact on the development of 
communication and social interaction of persons with autism and other neurodevelopmental 
disorders (Francis, 2003; Leitão, 2004; Lercari & Rivero, 2006; Bass, Duchowny & Llabre, 
2009; Ward et al., 2013 ), increase adaptive behaviour and motivation (Taylor et al., 2009), 
favourably affect motor skills (Freire, 2000; Wuang et al., 2010), help improve quality -of-life 
(Kern et al., 2011; Walter & Hesse, 2006), reduce maladaptive behaviours while providing 
significant improvements in adaptive skills (Cincinnati Therapeutic Horse -Riding and H., 
2006; Gabriels et al., 2009, 2012), lower the levels of cortisol and increase those of oxytocin 
(Tabares et al., 2012), and even improve some of the symptoms of the diso rder itself (Van den 
Hout, 2010; Kern et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2013). Those studies, however, investigated just Andrés García -Gómez et al.

use evalu ation tools that would allow one to make  an overall assessment, as would have been 
the case if they had applied a multidimensional instrument such as the BASC battery of Re y-
nolds & Kamphaus (1992).

Regardless of the possible therapeutic effects of the interaction with horses for persons  
with ASD, horse -riding is emerging as a suitable activity for children and adults with autism.  
Participation in sports and leisure activities is an essential element of any program targeted at 
improving people's quality -of-life (Schalock & Verdugo, 2002) .  As Rubio & García -Gómez 
(2011) show, horse -riding as a sport and leisure activity is an alternative that particularly fits Effects of a Program of Adapted Therapeutic Horse -riding in a Group of Autism Spectrum Disorder Children  
Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32                          - 113- 
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 the characteristics of persons with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD).  In essence, there are three reaso ns.  One is that, while done individually, multiple 
interactions come into play in a form that is more clearly structured than in other sports done 
in groups. Another is that it is primarily based on epidermal and tactile communication with 
the animal, as well as, although to a lesser extent, on verbal communication (which is usually 
altered in persons with autism). And the third is that it is done in a natural outdoor enviro n-
ment, something that is highly motivational.  
 
Physical exercise is good for everyo ne's health. But it is especially important for chi l-
dren with autism because their social, communicative, and motivational difficulties cause 
them to have lower levels of physical activity than the general population.  They therefore run 
the risk of additi onal disorders associated with this relative inactivity (Pan & Frey, 2006; Pan, 
2008; Kleinhans, 2010).  Although these studies have failed to provide completely definitive 
evidence (Sowa & Meulenbroek, 2012), it does seem that sport provides persons with ASD 
the opportunity of improving voluntary motor balance and movement, and their social and 
cognitive competences, of gaining confidence in their sporting activities, of reducing the 
emergence of stereotyped behaviours, and to some extent of relieving co -morbidities (Reid, 
2005; Szot, 1997; Rosenthal -Malek & Mitchell, 1997; Elliott et al., 1994; Keyes, 2009; 
Yanardağ, Yılmaz, & Aras, 2010).  
 
Aims  
Therefore, the intention with the present work was to try to ascertain the social and 
behavioural effects of a p rogram of initiation to horse -riding and of therapeutic horse -riding 
in a group of ASD pupils.  The variables to consider related to the subjects' adaptive capacity 
measured with the BASC battery of tests (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992) and to their quality -
of-life. 
 
Method  
 
Participants  
The sample consisted of 32 pupils diagnosed with ASD, attending mainstream schools 
in the Provinces of Cáceres and Badajoz, Spain. However, there is only enough information 
about 16. Two groups were formed: 8 pupils in the expe rimental group, and 8 in the control 
group. Their characteristics were:  Ages 7 to 14 years. 13 pupils lived in the City of Cáceres Andrés García -Gómez et al.  
 
- 114 -                      Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32   
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  and 3 lived in other towns in the Province, all in urban settings of Cáceres, Plasencia, and 
Trujillo  (Spain ). IQ > 50: two subjects in the range 50/70, and the rest with > 90. CARS 
scores: mean 31 (mild autism). No subject had had contact with horses during the two years 
prior to participating in the program, and only one had previously participated in horse -riding 
activities.  Conventional treatment, both medical and re -education, were maintained u n-
changed throug hout the program.  
 
Gender: 3 girls, 13 boys, for a ratio of 1:4 . The equivalent prevalence ratio for the 
general population is approximately 1:4 (Rodríguez -Barrionuevo  & Rodríguez -Vives, 2002).  
 
The sampling method was of convenience, since random sampling was unfeasible due 
to the dispersion of potential subjects.  
 
Instruments  
The dependent variables were  the social, affective, and emotional variables : adaptive 
skills,  social skills, leadership, withdrawal, anxiety, depression, behavioural problems, 
atypicality, aggressiveness, hyperactivity, attention problems, and somatization. They were 
measured through the multidimensional BASC -T (for Teachers) test battery  (Reynold s & 
Kamphaus, 1992).  This has five components that evaluate the subject from different 
perspectives and which can be used individually or in any combination. They are: a self -
report on personality; a structured developmental history; a pupil observation sy stem; and two 
assessment questionnaires, one for  parents (P) and one for teachers  (T), designed to collect 
information on the behaviour of the child or adolescent in different contexts.  We used the 
teacher rating form (T)  in the present study.  Reliability  of the global dimension of the BASC 
ranged from .77 to .91.  
 
Dependent variables related to  quality -of-life: measured  through an ad hoc parent 
questionnaire based on the Quality -of-Life Model  of Schalock & Verdugo (2002).  To elab o-
rate and validate the in strument, we used a procedure of consensus via inter -rater valid ation 
with a group of experts in the treatment of pupils with special educational needs.  The result 
was a 7 -item questionnaire yielding indicators of the following dimensions: emotional well -
being, interpe rsonal relationships, personal development, physical well -being, self -
determination, social i nclusion, and familial well -being.  The reliability indicator (Cro nbach's 
alpha) was acceptable (. 641).

http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 Intervention program  
The three -month interve ntion program consisted of twice -weekly sessions (a total of 
24 sessions) of three -quarters of an hour each, with groups of 4 pupils.  The practical sessions 
in which the pupils of the experimental group participated were held in the Monfragüe Eque s-
trian C entre of Cáceres, which has over fifteen years experience of training young riders in its 
Riding School. Each session consisted of three phases forming a continuum of the central ri d-
ing activity.  This pattern was based on that used by Bass, Duchowny & Lla bre (2009) which 
was designed and implemented by instructors with PATH International (Professional Associ a-
tion of Therapeutic Horsemanship International, formerly NARHA) training.  The first phase 
corresponded to activities prior to mounting – preparing th e equipment and the horse.  The 
second phase corresponded to mounting and riding.  In the first sessions, each pupil was 
helped by a monitor leading the horse with a halter.  The third phase corresponded to learning 
to round off the work with the horse, to  dismount, bring in the horse, gather and put away the 
equipment, and say goodbye to the horses and to the monitors.   
 
Because of the cognitive and behavioural characteristics of ASD children, some ada p-
tations were made to fit the riding activity to their particular educational needs. These were 
based on the work of Horvat, Németh & Gal (2003), Brown (1996), Rivière (1998), Hodgdon 
(1995), and Schopler, Mesibov & Hearsey (1995).  Essentially, they were: inciting the su b-
jects to do the program's activities b y assuming a lightly intrusive attitude; using highly stru c-
tured teac hing based on errorless learning; and using environmental visual structuring cues.  
 
 The educational objectives of the intervention were based primarily on the document 
“The regulations o f the official rating program for riders of the Spanish Equestrian Feder a-
tion”, in particular, in the content related to levels 1 and 2 of the gallop.  This text is available 
in “Curso de Equitación. Galopes. Niveles 1 al 4”, published in 2008 by Ediciones  Tutor S.A.  
The detailed information about the programme appears Rubio & García -Gómez (2011) and 
García -Gómez et al. (2012).  
 
Procedure  
Firstly, contacts with the parents from two Autism associations were established. They 
were invited to take part and wri tten permissions were requested for that participation in the 
programme. In addition, parents were asked to bring the necessary details for this study. Andrés García -Gómez et al.  
 
- 116 -                      Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32   
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  Thereafter, the insurance and the medical reports for the practice of horse riding were also 
requested.  
 
Before the start of these sessions of contact with a horse, two informative meetings 
were held with the monitors in which an autism specialist informed them of the subjects' basic 
characteristics, what their needs are, and what aspects are to be taken int o account when inte r-
acting with them.  Similarly, another two informative meetings were held in which the mon i-
tors i nformed the parents and other collaborators in the sessions about the basic characteristics 
of handling horses and what preventive practices  should be followed at all times. After these 
initial informative meetings, the program sessions themselves were initiated.  
 
Moreover, the collaborators of this study asked the teachers of these children to fill in 
the BASC questionnaire before and after t he treatment programme.  
 
Design and data analysis  
As noted above, the objective of this work was to examine the effects of a therapeutic 
horse -riding program (independent variable) on a group of personal, social, and emotional 
variables of pupils with ASD (dependent variables).  The design was to use a pre -test and 
post-test with an experimental and a control group.  The impossibility of forming the groups 
at random imposes a certain limit on the validity of its results.  In the classification termino l-
ogy o f Montero & León (2007), the design is a sub -class of quasi -experimental studies d e-
noted "quasi -control".  
 
 Nonparametric statistics were used for hypothesis testing since the samples were very 
small.  The significance level for intergroup differences was taken to be . 05.  Descriptive st a-
tistics were calculated for the appropriate variables.  
 
Results  
 
The presentation of the results will correspond to the impact of the therapeutic horse -
riding program on: a set of psychosocial variables as evaluated with th e BASC questionnaire 
and the quality -of-life as evaluated by an instrument based on the model of Schalock & Ve r-
dugo (2002).

BASC questionnaire  
The data from the que stionnaires completed by the teachers (BASC -T), as shown in 
Table 2, showed significant differences in the variable aggressiveness   p = .039; d = 0.220. In  
the initial assessment (test) to the experimental group, the mean score for the aggressiv eness 
varia ble was 4. 6 and af ter treatment (retest) it was 3. 33. It also highlights the score for hype r-
activity p = .077; d= 0.549. 
 
Suffice it to say that the values for the variable "atypicality" in the experimental group 
(p = .066; d = 0.392) are close to signific ance but in the control group also observed that 
maturation effect ( p = .063; d = 0.64).

 Consulting in Cohen's tabl es (1988) we obtain a power < 0. 25 for a sample of n = 8. 
Ist a very low statistical power, therefore this sample could only detect effect sizes d ≥ 0.70. 
Therefore there is a hi gh probability of making Type II  errors . So we included Cohen's d va l-
ues for consulting the effect size, the effect size is a solid statistic.  
 
Effects of the therapeutic horse -riding program on quality -of-life 
The questionn aire to assess the quality -of-life was completed by the parents of both 
groups (experimental and control) after completion of the intervention program.  The Mann -
Whitney test (Table 4) revealed significant differences in favour of the experimental group in  
the dimensions "Interpersonal relations" and "Social inclusion", although these specific i m-
provements were insufficient for there to be a significant difference in the total quality -of-life 
score (p = .086).

Discussion  and conclusions  
 
The socio -emotional variables evaluated by the BASC are to some extent  more d e-
pendent on the context than are the constituent variables of autism, and are therefore more 
influenced by intervention programs.  But we noted above that, of all the variables analysed in 
this survey, significant differences were only found in aggr essiveness ( p = .039).  
 
Some of the works consulted in our literature review refer to significant changes in 
some of the variables studied in the BASC. They did not use the same evaluation instrument 
however.  Leitão (2004) refers to improvements in behavi our and social interaction; the work 
of Cincinnati Therapeutic Horse -Riding & Horsemanship (2006) reports improvements in 
adapted behaviour; Bass, Duchowny & Llabre (2009), Kern et al. (2011) and Ward et al. 
(2013) refer to significant improvements in inte ractive competences; and Gabriels et al. 
(2012) report significant reductions in challenging behaviour.  In contrast, as noted above, our 
data show significant differences only in aggressiveness.  
 
The possible influence of the therapeutic horse -riding prog ram on the subjects' aggre s-
sive behaviour can be explained as being due to the relaxing effect even of passive physical 
activity (Von -Knorring et al., 2008).  The inability to control behaviour is a possible explan a-
tion of the nature of the restricted and repetitive behaviours of persons with ASD, and the or i-
gin of this executive dysfunction may be a deficit in frontal lobe functioning.  In this sense, 
Anderson -Hanley, Tureck & Schneiderman (2011) indicate that improving executive control Andrés García -Gómez et al.  
 
- 120 -                      Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32   
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  functions in perso ns with ASD together with the direct benefits of exercise may help them 
achieve greater behavioural control.  
 
There is a growing scientific literature demonstrating the psycho -physiological i m-
provements resulting from moderate intensity exercise in persons  with ASD, such as with the 
experimental subjects of the present study.  Sowa & Meulenbroek (2012) list the benefits that 
have been reported in the various studies in the literature on the effect of sporting activities on 
persons with ASD: constituting an opportunity for social integration; reduction in stereotyped 
behaviours; improving motor performance and physical capacities in general; fostering self -
determination and thereby improving their quality -of-life; improving cognitive skills and ac a-
demic perfo rmance; reducing stress; and improving social skills.  The work of Tabares et al. 
(2012) also lends a certain support to our data in that it finds reduced cortisol levels, increased 
progesterone levels, and therefore increased oxytocin levels in a group of  ASD individuals 
following sessions of hippotherapy.  This change in hormonal status favours, among other 
things, the modulation of aggressive behaviour.  
 
The last group of variables analysed were related to the quality -of-life.  Previous work 
has found th erapeutic horse -riding programs to improve the quality -of-life of persons with 
ASD (Kern et al., 2011).  Walter & Hesse (2006) also report improvements in the quality -of-
life of patients with psychiatric disorders (both neuroses and psychoses).  Our data s howed 
the experimental group pupils to obtain better indicators of quality -of-life than the control 
group pupils in two of the dimensions analysed – interpersonal relations and social inclusion.  
 
For an explanation, one must take into account the behaviour al characteristics of pe r-
sons with ASD.  Yanardağ, Yılmaz & Aras (2010) note that ASD children usually do not play 
with their peers or participate in physical and sports activities because of their difficulties in 
integrating and communicating with their c lassmates, their repetitive behaviours, restricted 
interests, and, in many cases, inferior motor performance.  Hence, giving them the opport u-
nity to participate in a leisure or sport physical activity such as horse -riding contributes d i-
rectly to improving their quality -of-life. 
 
By way of synthesis, we can say that the present study provides a vision that is co m-
plementary to foregoing work (Table 1 summarizes the literature consulted), and is the first to Effects of a Program of Adapted Therapeutic Horse -riding in a Group of Autism Spectrum Disorder Children  
Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,  12(1), 107-128. ISSN: 1696 -2095. 2014, no. 32                          - 121- 
http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115 contribute information on  the impact of therapeutic  horse -riding  on a comprehensive set of 
psychosocial skills evaluated with an instrument as complete as the BASC questionnaire.  
 
The therapeutic horse -riding program described in this work has involved a group of 
subjects with ASD in a range of sports and  leisure activities in which they have learned to 
handle horses and other aspects of horsemanship. This activity is particularly well matched to 
the specific characteristics of persons with autism, since it is based on an individual activity 
but at the sam e time brings into play multiple interactions in a context which is more stru c-
tured and less chaotic than other team sports.  Its essence is communication that is tactile and 
epidermal with the animal rather than verbal (which is usually altered in persons  with ASD), 
and it is performed in a highly motivating natural environment.  Thus, horse -riding, with the 
necessary adjustments to adapt it to this group of persons, is a sports and leisure activity that 
can well form part of the repertoire of activities s uggested for persons with ASD.  
 
Limitations  
Clear limitations of the present study need to be taken into account in interpreting the 
results in the sense that the improvements observed may have been due to other uncontrolled 
variables.  The quasi -experimen tal nature of the study design, with the control group not b e-
ing selected totally at random, may have influenced the results. The study sample was very 
small and in no way representative, so that it is not possible to generalize the findings to a la r-
ger po pulation. Also, the heterogeneity of the sample, with the diversity of profiles, to a ce r-
tain extent conditioned how the intervention sessions were carried out, and thus may have d i-
luted the effects of the treatment. And finally, the benefits can not be gu aranteed to be perm a-
nent since the study did not include a longitudinal type of design.  
 
These limitations are to some extent common to most of the works consulted on this 
topic, and could serve as a referent for the improved experimental design of new con tribu-
tions.  
 
Future research  
Finally we would note that, further effort is needed to allow greater control of the 
variables involved, with more strictly controlled designs, larger samples, longitudinal studies 
to evaluate the duration of any benefits, stud ies on samples with differing degrees of severity 
of the syndrome, and studies allowing variation in the intensity, duration, and frequency of Andrés García -Gómez et al.

http://dx.doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.3 2.13115  the sessions.  Also, one needs to determine the physical and psychological mechanisms and 
processes that are put into play in horse -riding that would explain its therapeutic benefits for 
persons with autism.

Ann Saudi Med 30(4) July-August 2010 www.saudiannals.net 295Autism is one of a group of neurodevelopmental 
disorders known as pervasive developmental 
disorders (PDD). These disorders are charac -
terized by three core deficits: impaired communication, 
impaired reciprocal social interaction and restricted, 
repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors or in -
terests. The presentation of these impairments is vari -
able in range and severity and often changes with the 
acquisition of other developmental skills. 
In 1943, the American psychiatrist Leo Kanner used 
the term “early infantile autism” to describe children who 
lacked interest in other people.1 In 1944, an Austrian 
pediatrician, Hans Asperger, independently described 
another group of children with similar behaviors, but 
with milder severity and higher intellectual abilities. 
Since then, his name has become attached to a higher 
functioning form of autism, Asperger syndrome.2 It 
was not until the 1980s that the term pervasive devel -
opmental disorders was first used. 
The definition and diagnosis of these disor -
ders has been broadened over the years to include 
milder forms of autism. The term autism spectrum 
disorders (ASDs) is currently used to describe 
three of the five pervasive developmental disorders 
listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and Autism spectrum disorders

Pervasive developmental disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by im -
pairments in communication, reciprocal social interaction and restricted repetitive behaviors or inter -
ests. The term autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been used to describe their variable presentation. 
Although the cause of these disorders is not yet known, studies strongly suggest a genetic basis with a 
complex mode of inheritance. More research is needed to explore environmental factors that could be 
contributing to the cause of these disorders. The occurrence of ASD has been increasing worldwide, 
with the most recent prevalence studies indicating that they are present in 6 per 1000 children. The 
objectives of this article are to provide physicians with relevant information needed to identify and refer 
children presenting with symptoms suggestive of ASDs to specialized centers early, and to make them 
feel comfortable in dealing with public concerns regarding controversial issues about the etiology and 
management of these disorders.

Edition (ICD-10): autistic disorder, Asperger disor -

wise specified (PDD-NOS), Table 1.3,4 
A diagnosis of autistic disorder is made when 
there are impairments in communication and recip -
rocal social interaction with the presence of restricted 
repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors or 
interests, prior to the age of 3 years. When autistic 
symptoms are present with no significant general 
delay in language and cognitive development, a di -
agnosis of Asperger disorder is made. A diagnosis 
of PDD-NOS is given when the triad of symptoms 
is present but the criteria are not met for a specific 
PDD.3 Often the label “high-functioning autism” is 
used interchangeably with Asperger disorder.5 This 
is controversial and there is considerable debate as to 
whether children with Asperger disorder, who have 
normal language milestones, should be considered to 
comprise a subgroup distinct from high-functioning 
children with autism, who have a history of delayed 
language development.6 The other two PDD’s, Rett 
syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, are 
rare and are associated with significant developmental 
regression, which makes them more distinct than the 
other disorders in the PDD group.3 review AUTISM
Ann Saudi Med 30(4) July-August 2010 www.saudiannals.net 296Epidemiology 
ASD occurs more often in boys than girls, with a 4:1 
male-to-female ratio.7 The reported prevalence rates of 
autism and its related disorders have been increasing 
worldwide over the past decades, from approximately 
4 per 10 000 to 6 per 1000 children.8-12 The reasons for 
this increase include wider public awareness of these 
disorders, broadening of the diagnostic concepts, reclas -
sifications of disorders and improved detection.7,13 The 
possibility that the increase in the reported cases is a 
result of unidentified risk factor(s) cannot be ruled out, 
and therefore more research is needed to address this. 
Etiology 
The exact cause of autism and the other ASDs is still 
not known. The etiologic theories have changed over 
the years. It was once thought to be the result of faulty 
child-rearing. This historical psychosocial theory has 
been rejected, as research clearly indicates that the eti -
ology is multi-factorial with a strong genetic basis.14 
Although the etiology is not clear, there are a minority 
of cases, less than 10%, where autism is part of another 
condition. Such cases are often referred to as “second -
ary” autism; these include tuberous sclerosis, fragile X 
syndrome, phenylketonuria and congenital infections 
secondary to rubella and cytomegalovirus.14-20 
Genetic factors 
Family studies have demonstrated that autism is both 
familial and heritable. The recurrence rate in siblings 
of an autistic child is 2% to 8%, which is higher than 
that of the general population.8,17 Furthermore, twin 
studies showed that monozygotic twins have a high -
er concordance rate than dizygotic twins—90% and 
10%, respectively.14,15,17 Other genetic studies suggest 
a complex mode of inheritance, with linkage studies 
suggesting genetic loci on several chromosomes in -
cluding chromosome 717 and  chromosome X.15 
Environmental factors 
Various environmental factors have been explored as 
possible causative agents in autism. Epidemiological studies indicate that some environmental factors, in -
cluding prenatal infections with rubella and cytomeg -
alovirus, account for few cases of autism.17 The role of 
heavy metals in the etiology of autism is controversial 
and requires more research.21 
There are public concerns about vaccines being 
possible triggers for autism. There have been two 
separate hypothesis relating vaccination to autism, 
the first is the potential adverse effect of the measle, 
mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and the second is 
that of thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used 
in some vaccines. These two hypotheses are distinct 
from each other; MMR vaccines have never con -
tained thimerosal, because it would inactivate a live 
vaccine.7 
Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the ASD 
hypothesis 
An article published in 1998 suggested a possible re -
lationship between the MMR vaccine and ASD. Since 
then, there has been a decline in the rate of MMR 
vaccination among children.22,23 As a consequence of 
that, there have been measles outbreaks.23 These fac -
tors led to the conduction of large worldwide studies 
to examine this potential relationship. These studies 
showed that there is no association between MMR 
vaccine and ASDs.24-29 The measles vaccine has been 
proven to be safe and effective in preventing this po -
tentially lethal disease. Therefore, with the lack of sci -
entific evidence that MMR vaccine is causally related 
to autism, the administration of MMR vaccine should 
be encouraged to prevent measles outbreak. 
Thimerosal and the ASD hypothesis 
Thimerosal is a mercury-containing compound that 
has been used as an additive to vaccines to prevent bac -
terial contamination. In 1997, the United States Food 
and Drug Administration called for assessment of the 
risk of all mercury-containing foods and drugs. This 
action stimulated the United States Public Health 
Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics to 
issue a joint statement in 1999 calling for the removal 
of thimerosal from the vaccines. This action was un -
dertaken as a precautionary measure. There was no 
evidence that mercury was harmful at the doses be -
ing administered in the vaccines.30 The evidence from 
these studies does not support and favors rejection of 
a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing 
vaccines and autism.28,31-34 Further evidence contra -
dicting this hypothesis is that rates of autism have 
continued to increase despite the removal of thimero -
sal from vaccines in 1999.7,33 Table 1 . The five pervasive developmental disorders.

Physicians play an important role in early recognition of 
ASD, because they are usually the first point of contact 
for parents. Therefore, it is important that physicians be 
able to recognize the various signs and symptoms of this 
group of disorders.35 Physicians should be alerted to 
the possibility of autism and its related disorders when 
there are qualitative impairments in social, language and 
communication skills, as well as repetitive interests and 
behaviors. The severity of these impairments varies sig -
nificantly among children with ASD. Even though the 
typical age of onset is before 3 years, the impairments 
can be subtle and may not be detected before school age. 
An example of this are children with Asperger disorder, 
who may be identified and diagnosed much later than 
children with typical autism, on average at 11 years of 
age.5 This is because parents of children with Asperger 
disorder may not recognize the subtle abnormalities in 
their child’s behavior, because they may not have an op -
portunity to compare them to peers. Conversely, physi -
cians and teachers compare a child’s behavior to typi -
cally developing children and notice abnormalities and 
impairments more easily.5 This reflects the importance 
of gathering information about the child from multiple 
sources, especially when diagnosing the broader perva -
sive developmental disorders.5,36 
The diagnosis is challenging in children at the both 
ends of the spectrum. Children with severe autistic 
symptoms may be hard to differentiate from those with 
isolated severe intellectual disability, while those with 
mild symptoms may be misdiagnosed as having a lan -
guage disorder or a social anxiety. T able 2 lists some of 
the general developmental warnings of possible ASD in 
children and adolescents. 
Several structured instruments have been used for 
screening for ASDs in high-risk children, e.g. siblings 
of autistic children, children with developmental de -
lay or genetic syndromes. The Checklist for Autism in 
T oddlers (CHAT), Modified-Checklist for Autism in 
T oddlers (M-CHAT), Childhood Autism Rating Scale 
(CARS) and Social Responsiveness Scale-Parent and 
T eacher (SRS), are some of the widely used instruments 
for screening these high-risk children.37-40 Although 
these are well-structured instruments, they should be 
used with caution as they are screening tests and should 
not be used to rule out or confirm the diagnosis. 
The diagnosis of ASD is best achieved by a team of 
health care professionals who are well informed and ex -
perienced in these disorders. Therefore, a primary care 
health worker should refer any child suspected of hav -
ing ASD to a specialist team for detailed assessment. 
The specialist team makes the diagnosis of ASD based on an autism-specific history and clinical observation. 
Specific tools commonly used in the assessment include 
the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) 
and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule 
(ADOS).41-43 
Most children with ASDs have a normal physical 
examination. The physical examination should include 
observations of any dysmorphic features or skin pig -
mentations along with a detailed neurological examina -
tion that may be suggestive of secondary causes, such 
as fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis. Currently, 
there are no laboratory or radiologic tests to diagnose 
ASD. The diagnostic yield from biomedical investiga -
tions is low.44 Most guidelines and practice parameters 
on ASD recommend conducting DNA analysis for frag -
ile X syndrome, regular karyotyping, audiology testing 
and other investigations where clinically relevant.45,46 
The yield of an etiologic investigation may be increased 
with the presence of coexisting developmental delay or 
intellectual disability.8 
Treatment 
ASDs are lifelong chronic disabilities. At present, there 
is no cure for the core symptoms of autism. However, 
several groups of medications, including atypical neu -
roleptics, have been used to treat associated behavioral 
problems such as aggression and self-injurious behav -
iors.47,48 
Research has shown that the most effective therapy 
is use of early intensive behavioral interventions that 
aim to improve the functioning of the affected child. 
These interventions focus on developing language, 
social responsiveness, imitation skills, and appropri -
ate behaviors. Examples of these behavioral thera -
pies include ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) and 
TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and 
Related Communication Handicapped Children). The 
ABA approach involves teaching new behaviors by ex -
plicit reinforcement; problem behaviors are addressed 
by analyzing triggers in order to change factors in the 
environment that are contributing to that behavior.49 
The TEACCH approach takes advantage of relative 
strengths in visual information processing using strate -
gies such as visual schedules, clearly structured and or -
ganized classrooms, and highly structured learning ac -
tivities that are broken down into manageable, visually 
organized steps.49 These behavioral techniques should 
begin early in the pre-school period and be followed by 
highly individualized educational intervention in the 
school.50-54

for ASD, families have been seeking complementary review AUTISM

clude the use of mega-vitamins and other nutritional 
supplements, chelation therapy and hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy. Currently, there is no evidence to support the 
use of nutritional supplements as an intervention for 
ASD.21,55,56 There have been claims that diets free of 
casein and/or gluten are effective interventions for 
autism. The latest Cochrane review in 2008 reported 
lack of evidence to support the use of these diets for 
children with ASD, and stated that there is a lack of re -
search on the potential harms and disbenefits of these 
diets.56 Therefore, families who desire to try these di -
ets should be counseled on the need for calcium and 
vitamin D supplements with attention to the protein 
intake, since milk and dairy products represent major 
sources of calcium and protein intake for these young 
children. 
Despite the lack of scientific evidence, desperate 
and vulnerable parents seek chelation therapy for their 
affected children in an attempt to remove heavy metals 
that are thought to cause autism.57 The use of chela -
tion therapy in children with autism and its related 
disorders has not been validated. Furthermore, it is an 
invasive procedure and can have fatal consequences.57 
Recently, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has increased in 
popularity as an alternative therapy for ASDs.58 This therapy involves inhaling up to 100% oxygen in a pres -
surized chamber to increase plasma oxygen to the tis -
sues including the brain.58,59 Because of the limited 
research in this field, conclusions about the efficacy of 
hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a treatment for children 
with ASDs cannot be drawn at this time.58-60 
Conclusion 
ASDs are a group of disorders characterized by im -
pairments in three domains, namely communication, 
reciprocal social interaction and behaviors that are 
restricted and repetitive in nature. Physicians play a 
crucial role in the early identification of children with 
these disorders since they are the first point of con -
tact and the starting point for referral to appropriate 
centers for further evaluation and management. These 
disorders are increasing in prevalence, so that physi -
cians are more likely to encounter them during their 
practice. Therefore, physicians need to be aware of 
the variable presentation of these disorders in order 
to identify affected children early and refer them ap -
propriately to specialized centers for evaluation, coun -
seling and intervention. Furthermore, physicians need 
to feel comfortable in dealing with public concerns 
regarding controversial issues about the etiology and 
management of these disorders.

Abstract This study investigated reading skills in 41
children with autism spectrum disorder. Four componentsof reading skill were assessed: word recognition, nonword
decoding, text reading accuracy and text comprehension.
Overall, levels of word and nonword reading and text
reading accuracy fell within average range although reading
comprehension was impaired. However, there was consid-erable variability across the sample with performance on
most tests ranging from ﬂoor to ceiling levels. Some chil-
dren read accurately but showed very poor comprehension,consistent with a hyperlexia reading proﬁle; some children
were poor at reading words and nonwords whereas others
were unable to decode nonwords, despite a reasonable levelof word reading skill. These ﬁndings demonstrate the het-
erogeneous nature of reading skills in children with ASD.

Introduction
Although there is a general assumption that reading is a
relative strength for children with autism spectrum disor-ders (ASD), systematic data concerning levels of reading
ability in this population are lacking. Two rather differentperspectives can be drawn from the existing literature.
First, it is well accepted that poor oral language skills place
children at high risk for literacy failure (e.g., Bishop &
Snowling, 2004 ; Catts & Kamhi, 2005), and since many
children with autism have language impairments (e.g.,Tager-Flusberg & Joseph, 2003 ), difﬁculty with learning to
read is to be expected. In contrast to this expectation,
numerous case studies describe exceptional levels ofreading skill in some children with autism (e.g., Turkeltaub
et al., 2004 ). Clearly however, one needs to be cautious
when generalising from single case studies, especially gi-ven the wide variation in cognitive and linguistic skills
seen in individuals with an ASD.
Reading is a complex skill and to read even a simple
sentence demands a number of skills ranging from rec-
ognising each individual word through to understanding the
intended meaning of a text. Broadly, Perfetti, Landi, andOakhill ( 2005 ) describe two major classes of processing
events that are necessary for successful reading compre-
hension: (1) the identiﬁcation of words and (2) theengagement of language processing mechanisms that
assemble words into messages. Together, ‘‘these processes
provide contextually appropriate word meanings, parseword strings into constituents, and provide inferential
integration of sentence information into more complete
representations of extended text.’’ (Perfetti et al., 2005 ,
p. 229). It is clear that successful reading comprehension
demands that both sets of processes operate adequately:
without adequate reading accuracy, reading comprehensionwill fail, and being able to read words accurately is no
guarantee that successful comprehension will follow. As
these two sets of processes can develop out-of-step(Hoover & Gough, 1990 ; Nation, 2005 ; Perfetti et al.,

1232005 ), it is important to consider them separately when
assessing how well children with autism read.
Reading Accuracy and Autism
A number of studies highlight good reading accuracy skills
in both adults (Rumsey & Hamburger, 1990 ) and children
(Minshew, Goldstein, Taylor, & Siegel, 1994 ; O’Connor &
Hermelin, 1994 ; O’Connor & Klein, 2004 ) with autism,
and in some samples, reading accuracy is in excess of IQ-
expected levels (Mayes & Calhoun, 2003 ; Szatmari, Tuff,
Finlayson, & Bartolucci, 1990 ).
Frith and Snowling ( 1983 ) investigated aspects of
reading accuracy in a group of nine children with autism,relative to a group of normally-developing children mat-
ched for reading level. One question they addressed con-
cerned the strategies children with autism used to readwords. They reasoned that rather than decoding or deci-
phering words using a phonological ‘sounding-out’ strat-
egy, children with autism may capitalise on rotememorisation and recognise words on the basis of shape or
pattern recognition. To test this idea, Frith and Snowling
asked children to read aloud nonwords. As nonwords needto be decoded on the basis of letter-sound associations, if
children with autism read by relying heavily on visual
strategies, nonword reading should be compromised.However, children with autism were indistinguishable from
control children in terms of nonword reading. This suggests
that they were as skilled as normally-developing childrenof equivalent reading level at using phonological-based
reading strategies.
A limitation of these studies is that they only included
children who were reading at a reasonably advanced level.
For example, Minshew et al. ( 1994 ) recruited high-
functioning children, and the mean verbal IQ of theirsample was 97. Frith and Snowling’s study selection crite-
ria demanded that all participants had essentially
age-appropriate reading skills, according to a standardisedtest. Thus, these studies permit few conclusions to be made
concerning levels of reading accuracy competence across a
population of children with an ASD. In line with this cau-tion, descriptions of individuals with ASD point to con-
siderable variability in levels of word and nonword reading
accuracy (for review see Nation, 1999 ). As noted above, it is
difﬁcult to generalise from single case data and as different
researchers measure reading ability in different ways,comparison across studies is also difﬁcult. Nevertheless, a
number of case descriptions indicate that some children with
ASD are very poor at reading nonwords, despite the fact thatthey are relatively skilled at reading words (Aaron, Fantz, &
Manges, 1990 ; Goldberg & Rothermel, 1984 ). This suggests
that for some autistic children at least, reading accuracy maynot be underpinned by adequate phonological decodingskills, as is the case in normal reading development (e.g.,
Goswami & Bryant, 1990 ).
Reading Comprehension and Autism
Turning to the other component of reading ability, there is
broad agreement that children with autism have impaired
reading comprehension, an observation ﬁrst made byKanner ( 1943 , reprinted in Kanner, 1973, p. 42) in his
original description of autism: ‘‘the children read monot-
onously, and a story ... is experienced in unrelated portionsrather than its coherent totality’’. Despite the high-
functioning nature of the sample recruited by Minshew
et al. ( 1994 ), levels of reading comprehension were sig-
niﬁcantly lower in the children with autism relative to
IQ-matched controls. Consistent with this, the children in
Frith and Snowling’s study performed less well than con-trols on a test of reading comprehension, despite the fact
that the two groups of children were well-matched in terms
of reading accuracy.
This proﬁle of impaired reading comprehension but
well-developed word recognition skills is consistent with
the pattern of reading behaviour seen in hyperlexia, theterm given to children who, despite pronounced cognitive
and linguistic deﬁcits, show remarkably advanced word
recognition skills (Grigorenko, Klin, & Volkmar, 2003 ;
Nation, 1999 ). Such apparently well-developed reading
skills are usually only superﬁcial. Reading accuracy is
well-developed and precocious but reading comprehensionis severely impaired. Although it is clear that a hyperlexic-
like reading pattern may occur in non-autistic children
(Nation, Clarke, & Snowling, 2002 ; Snowling & Frith,
1986 ), there is a strong association between autism and
hyperlexia. Many children who have a hyperlexic reading
proﬁle are autistic, or show features of autism (e.g., Gri-gorenko et al., 2002 ). It is not clear why this is the case
but Nation ( 1999 ) speculated that a number of factors may
be important: a particular pattern of cognitive and lin-guistic strengths and weaknesses, a tendency to be inter-
ested in local features rather than global coherence, and a
preoccupation with text and reading. As these featurestend to cluster together in people with autism, patterns of
hyperlexic reading are therefore more common in this
group.
In summary, there is evidence that some children with
autism can read accurately, but even amongst these chil-dren, levels of reading comprehension are poor (Frith &
Snowling, 1983 ; Minshew et al., 1994 ; O’Connor & Klein,
2004 ; Snowling & Frith, 1986 ). Thus, it is tempting to
conclude that many children with autism are hyperlexic,
especially given the observation that many children with
hyperlexia are autistic, or show features of autism(Grigorenko et al., 2002 ; Nation, 1999 ). However, it is912 J Autism Dev Disord (2006) 36:911–919
123difﬁcult to generalise studies reporting good levels of
reading accuracy in children with autism as samples were
selected on the basis of cognitive ability or reading ability.Excluding children with poor language and literacy may
result in an overestimation of levels of reading accuracy in
children with autism. Given the severe oral languageimpairments that characterise many children with autism
(Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg, 2001 ; Lord & Paul, 1997 ;
Tager-Flusberg & Joseph, 2003 ), and the close relation-
ship between oral language impairment and difﬁculties
with learning to read (Bishop & Snowling, 2004; Catts &
Kamhi, 2005; Nation, Clarke, Marshall, & Durand, 2004 ),
poor reading in at least some children with an ASD is to
be expected. By using standardised tests that assess dif-
ferent aspects of reading, the present study investigated arange of reading skills in a population of children with
ASD. The following questions and predictions were
explored:
1. What is the level of reading ability in a relatively large
and relatively broad population of children with ASD?
Based on the literature reviewed above, and given the
heterogeneous nature of ASD, we anticipated consid-erable variation in levels of reading ability in our
sample.
2. What are the levels of component reading skill
(accuracy and comprehension)? There is clear evi-
dence that reading comprehension is often impaired in
children with ASD and therefore we anticipateddepressed levels of reading comprehension in our
sample. Given the association between poor reading
comprehension and oral language comprehension (e.g.,Nation et al., 2004 ), we predicted that children with
poor reading comprehension would show concomitant
weaknesses in aspects of oral language.
3. Do discrepancies between (relatively strong) reading
accuracy and (relatively weak) reading comprehension
characterise the reading proﬁle of children with ASD?Children described as hyperlexic are often autistic, or
show autistic features (e.g., Grigorenko et al., 2002 ;
Nation, 1999 ). By examining discrepancies between
accuracy and comprehension in our sample, we aimed
to explore the extent to which a ‘hyerplexic’ proﬁle
typiﬁes patterns of reading behaviour in children withASD.
4. Finally, we investigated levels of nonword reading in
our sample. Some case reports suggest that somechildren with ASD show unexpected difﬁculties with
decoding novel words (e.g., Aaron et al., 1990 ;
Goldberg & Rothermel, 1984 ). We examined the ex-
tent to which nonword reading deﬁcits characterise the
pattern of reading skills seen in a relatively large
population of children with ASD.Method
Participants
Children were recruited from a Child and Adolescent
Mental Health Clinic serving the City of York and sur-
rounding areas. To explore patterns of reading in as general
a sample as possible, we imposed only two selection cri-teria. Chronological age was the ﬁrst criterion. In the UK,
children begin formal literacy instruction before their 5th
birthday, and by 6 years, reading skills are becoming rea-sonably well established in the normal population. We
therefore recruited children from 6 years upwards. An
upper limit of 15 years was chosen. Our second selectioncriterion was that language skills were sufﬁcient enough to
allow them to participate in our study. No formal criterion
was employed. Instead, clinicians were asked to referchildren they considered to have ‘‘measurable language
skills, however minimal’’. On the basis of these criteria, 68
families of children with an autism spectrum disorder agedbetween 6 and 15 years of age were sent an information
sheet about the study and invited to take part. Forty fam-
ilies agreed to take part; one family had two children withautism, making a total of 41 children (36 boys and 5 girls).
The mean age of the sample was 10.33 years.
The children varied as to their particular diagnosis on
the autistic spectrum. Diagnoses had been made by expe-
rienced clinicians using research diagnostic criteria in a
multidisciplinary diagnostic forum, according to ICD-10(World Health Organization, 1993 ) criteria. Sixteen chil-
dren fulﬁlled criteria for autism (including one child with
Fragile-X syndrome), 13 for atypical autism and 12 forAsperger’s syndrome. This relatively high proportion of
children with Asperger’s syndrome probably reﬂects our
request that minimal language skills be in place.
Materials and Procedure
Children were tested in their homes or in a quiet room in
their schools. The tests were presented in a single sessionlasting approximately 1.5 h. Rest periods were allowed as
required.
We made four assessments of reading, three tapping
aspects of reading accuracy and one tapping reading
comprehension.
Reading Accuracy
The ﬁrst measure of reading accuracy was decoding,
measured by a nonword reading test, The Graded Nonword
Reading Test (Snowling, Stothard, & McLean,
1996 ). This
provides a relatively pure measure of decoding as children
need to apply letter-sound rules in order to read aloud itemsJ Autism Dev Disord (2006) 36:911–919 913
123they have never seen before. The nonword reading test
comprises 10 one-syllable and 10 two-syllable nonwords
and is standardised on a UK sample.1Our second measure
of reading accuracy tapped word recognition and was as-
sessed using the reading subtest of the British Ability
Scales (BAS-II; Elliot, Smith, & McCulloch, 1996 ), an
untimed test in which children read aloud single words
presented one-at-a-time out of context. Our third measure
of reading accuracy assessed how well children read con-nected text. This was assessed using the Neale Analysis of
Reading Ability-II (NARA-II; Neale, 1997 ). This test re-
quires children to read aloud short passages of text. Thenumber of errors they make is noted and used to form a
reading accuracy score.
Reading Comprehension
The NARA-II also provided a measure of reading compre-
hension. After reading each passage, children were asked
questions to assess their understanding of what they had read.Some of the questions tapped literal understanding of the
passage, whereas others required an inference to be made.
Oral Language Skills
Two measures of oral language skill were made. Receptive
vocabulary was assessed using the British Picture Vocab-
ulary Scale-II (BPVS-II; Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley,
1997 ). Children are presented with four pictures and asked
to point to the picture which represents a word spoken
aloud by the tester. The comprehension subtest from theWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III
UK;
Wechsler, 1992 ) provided a measure of oral language
comprehension. This test requires children to understandlanguage in the absence of concrete or pictorial context; it
also requires them to use world knowledge, an important
requirement for establishing reference and understandingintended meaning (e.g., Milosky, 1990 ).
Nonverbal Ability
The Block Design subtest from the WISC-III
UKprovided
an estimate of nonverbal ability.Results
Levels of Reading SkillNine children were completely unable to read. These were
amongst the youngest in the sample (mean age 7.28 years;
mean age for the remaining sample was 10.85 years) andincluded six children with autism (4 boys and 2 girls), and
three with atypical autism (3 boys). These children were
excluded from further analyses. Table 1summarises the
performance of the remaining 32 children on tests of
reading, language and nonverbal ability. Note that some
children performed below the ﬂoor of standard scores onsome of the tests. To be conservative, a score one point
below the standardisation ﬂoor was awarded (for example,
the NARA-II standard score ﬂoor is 70; children failing toattain this level of performance were awarded a standard
score of 69). Mean standard scores for the three measures
of reading accuracy (word reading, text reading and non-word reading) were within normal range. In contrast,
reading comprehension was, on average, about 1SD below
population norms. However, it is important to note theextreme variability within the sample: as is clear from the
range of scores shown in Table 1, performance on these
measures of reading—and indeed most of the tests in thebattery—varied from ﬂoor to ceiling levels (range infor-
mation for each test is also provided in Table 1).
Component Reading SkillsTo investigate patterns of reading performance in more
detail, our next set of analyses examined four component
reading skills, namely the ability to read aloud single wordspresented out of context, the ability to decode nonwords,
the ability to read connected text accurately and the ability
to comprehend text. Table 2shows the correlation between
these four components of reading skill. Although the tests
inter-correlated at a statistically signiﬁcant level, the cor-
relations were fairly modest in size and were smaller thanthose observed in samples of typically-developing children.
To illustrate, correlations taken from Nation and Snow-
ling’s ( 1997 ) study of 184 7–11 year old children are
shown in parentheses in Table 2. Fisher exact tests were
used to investigate whether the size of each correlation was
signiﬁcantly greater in the normative sample compared tothe children with ASD. The correlations between word
reading and text reading ( z= 2.37), word reading and

lation between word reading and nonword reading between

standardisation sample were transformed to form standard scores
which were then used to quantify the performance of children in thepresent study. Standard scores for the older children in the presentstudy (aged 14 and 15 years) were obtained from a group of 50 15-
year old typically-developing adolescents reported by Snowling,
Bishop, and Stothard ( 2000 ). Consistent with Snowling et al., the test
was made more difﬁcult for the older children by adding ﬁve non-words ( strumbesh, delathode, tralishent, grikimest, pragendent ).914 J Autism Dev Disord (2006) 36:911–919
123the two groups did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
(z= 1.44). Taken together, these observations suggest that
in children with ASD, component reading skills have atendency to develop out of step with each other.
Deﬁcits in Reading Comprehension
Sixty-ﬁve percent of our sample showed poor reading
comprehension, as deﬁned as standard scores at least 1SD
below population norms, and 38 %scored more than 2SDs
below population norms (i.e., standard scores of 70 andbelow, the ﬂoor of the test). However, it would be wrong to
consider all of these children as hyperlexic as many
showed concomitant difﬁculties with reading accuracy.The relationship between word reading and reading com-
prehension is shown in Fig. 1. Cases below the line indi-
cate children for whom reading comprehension was poor,relative to word reading ability. Particularly striking are
those cases falling towards the bottom right quadrant of the
scatterplot. Despite high levels of word reading ability,reading comprehension was very poor. Thus, these children
showed poor reading comprehension despite achieving a
satisfactory level of word reading.
Of the 32 children with measurable reading ability, 20
achieved word-reading levels in the normal range or above
(i.e., a standard score above 85). Ten of these children alsohad reading comprehension within the normal range or
above, whereas 10 showed impaired reading comprehen-sion (i.e., below 85). Table 3summarises the performance
of these two subgroups of skilled and less-skilled com-
prehenders on the various measures of reading and lan-guage. The two groups were similar in age and nonverbal
ability, and not surprisingly, the two groups did not differ
on any of the measures of reading accuracy. Interestinglyhowever, the less-skilled comprehenders showed impair-
ments in vocabulary, and in oral language comprehension,
relative to the skilled comprehenders. Thus, impairments inreading comprehension are accompanied by weakness in
oral language skills in this group of children. Consistent
with this group comparison, across the entire sample therewas a strong correlation between reading comprehension
and vocabulary ( r= 0.72, P< .01) and oral language
comprehension ( r= 0.67, P< .01).
Discrepancies between Reading Accuracy and Reading
Comprehension
The NARA-II provides a useful tool for assessing the
extent to which children with ASD show deﬁcits in reading
comprehension, relative to the level expected on the basis
of text reading accuracy. As illustrated in Table 2, theTable 1 Performance of

123correlation between accuracy and comprehension was
signiﬁcant ( r= 0.568, P< .05) but substantially lower
than the correlation seen in Nation and Snowling’s ( 1997 )
normative study ( r= 0.87, P< .01; Fisher’s exact
z= 3.11, P< .01). In addition, the majority of our group
of children with ASD showed a discrepancy betweenreading comprehension and reading accuracy and for some
children the gap between the two sets of skills was sub-
stantial. Of the 32 children with measurable reading skills,10.3%achieved a comprehension score that was in excess
of 2 SDs below their accuracy score (a gap greater than 30
standard score points; mean difference = 49.3 standardscore points, range 46–52). A further 24.12 %obtained a
comprehension score 1–2 SDs below their level of reading
accuracy (mean difference = 19.85 standard score points,
range 16–26). Although the majority of the sample
(65.5%) achieved comprehension and accuracy scores
within 1SD of each other, it is worth noting that even for
these children, comprehension scores were lower than
accuracy scores (mean difference = 5.84 standard scorepoints, range 0–14). Only one child showed the reverse
pattern obtaining a comprehension score three points in
excess of his reading accuracy score. Thus, these obser-vations suggest that difﬁculties with reading comprehen-
sion are not uncommon in children with ASD and that for
approximately 35 %of the population of children who can
read single words at a reasonable level, reading compre-
hension is at least 1SD below text reading accuracy levels.
Unfortunately, the NARA-II manual does not provide
information concerning the frequency or magnitude of
accuracy-comprehension discrepancies in the standardisa-
tion sample. However, we were able to address this issueusing normative data from 562 normally-developing chil-
dren aged between 7 and 12 years (Nation & Snowling,
unpublished data). This representative sample achieved amean accuracy standard score of 98.22 ( SD12.03), a
mean comprehension score of 94.09 ( SD10.70), and thecorrelation between accuracy and comprehension was
0.718. Consistent with this high correlation, the majority of
children in the sample (88.6 %) achieved a comprehension
score within 1SD of their accuracy score. A further 10.9 %
obtained a comprehension score 1–2 SDs lower than their
accuracy score (compared to 24.12 %in the ASD group);
only 0.5%of the sample obtained a comprehension score
more than 2SDs below their accuracy scores (compared to
10.3%in the ASD group). Finally, in sharp contrast to the
sample with ASD where only one child showed the reverse
pattern of accuracy scores in advance of comprehension,
36.8%of the normative sample showed this reading
proﬁle.
Deﬁcits in Decoding
Although problems with reading comprehension charac-
terised the majority of children in the group, it is worth
noting that many of the children were poor at decodingnonwords. Of the sample of 32 children who were able to
read words at all, 42 %were at least 1SD below population
norms for nonword reading and 22 %of the sample scored
at least 2SD below population norms. As noted above, in
the normal population, the correlation between word and
nonword reading is high (for example, Nation & Snowling(1997 ) reported a correlation of 0.83; Snowling et al.
(1996 ) reported a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.78 between
nonword reading and word recognition; Torgesen, Wagner,& Rashotte ( 1999 ) reported correlation coefﬁcients
between 0.78 and 0.80 between these two variables). The
correlation of .69 between word and nonword reading in
our sample of children (shown in Fig. 2) suggests that word
recognition (word reading) and phonological decoding
(nonword reading) are not so tightly linked in this group.Perhaps most striking are those children who, despite
adequate levels of word reading, were poor at decoding
nonwords. While these children were low in number (toTable 3 Comparison of performance on measures of reading, language and nonverbal ability for children with skilled vs. less-skilled reading

Discussion
This study permits a number of conclusions to be made
concerning levels of reading ability in children with ASD.
Of those families agreeing to take part in our study, 78 %of
children had measurable reading abilities in that they were
able to read aloud single-words presented out of context.
As a whole, the group showed normal-range levels ofreading accuracy, but reading comprehension was lower.
However, there was considerable variation within the
group such that performance on all of the reading testsvaried from near ﬂoor to near ceiling. Thus, group means
are relatively uninformative when considering component
reading skills in this group of children.
As anticipated, a large proportion of children showed
impaired reading comprehension: 65 %of the sample
obtained reading comprehension at least 1SD below popu-lation norms, and about one-third of the sample showed
very severe reading comprehension impairments. For some
of these children, problems with reading comprehension
may well have stemmed from inadequate reading accuracy:
if children are unable to recognise or decode the words in atext, it is not surprising that they are unable to understand its
meaning. However, of the 20 children who achieved normal
range word reading skills, 10 showed poor reading com-prehension. For these children, their poor comprehension
could not be attributed to deﬁcits in word- or text-level
reading accuracy. Compared with children with normal-range reading comprehension skill, these children showed
impairments in vocabulary and oral language comprehen-
sion, suggesting that impairments in reading comprehensionaccompany impairments in understanding language more
generally (Bishop & Adams, 1990 ; Nation et al., 2004 ).
Given the high proportion of children with autism who
experience difﬁculty with reading comprehension (despite
possessing adequate levels of decoding ability), an
important direction for future work is to pinpoint whichaspects of the reading comprehension process are impaired.
This is a vital ﬁrst step if appropriate and well-targeted
interventions are to be put in place. Comprehension isclearly a very complex process which may fail for a
number of different reasons. O’Connor and Klein ( 2004 )
highlighted a number of aspects of the comprehensionprocess that may be particularly problematic for people
with autism: for example, a general difﬁculty with inte-
grating information, difﬁculty understanding and resolvinganaphoric reference, a difﬁculty with bringing prior
knowledge to bear when reading text (see also Wahlberg &
Magliano, 2004 ) and difﬁculties with comprehension
monitoring. Encouragingly, O’Connor and Klein
(2004 ) also reported data indicating that reading compre-
hension was facilitated in their sample of high-functioningstudents with ASDs when the experimenter focussed on an
aspect of the comprehension process, for example, direct-
ing attention to the anaphoric link between a pronounand its antecedent in a text. While it remains to be seen
whether ﬁndings from such experimental manipulations
can translate to a classroom situation when a child isworking independently, O’Connor and Klein’s study
illustrates the importance of considering the underlying
reasons why children with autism are poor at readingcomprehension.
Although 32/41 of our sample had measurable word
reading skills and as a group, the children showed aver-age-for-age word reading ability, it is interesting to note
that many children struggled to decipher nonwords. At
ﬁrst glance, this ﬁnding is surprising. Nonwords aremeaningless strings of letters that need to be decoded
using letter-sound correspondence rules; one might antic-
ipate that this skill should be a relative strength for chil-
dren with autism. Indeed, Minshew et al. ( 1994 ) found that
nonword reading was relatively better than word readingin their sample of high-functioning children with autism.
Generally, our data demonstrate rather low levels of
nonword reading ability, and for some individuals, non-word reading skills were considerably below the level
expected given their level of word reading ability. This
may reﬂect the fact that our sample was not selected onthe basis of either reading ability (cf. Frith & Snowling,
1983 ) or IQ (cf. Minshew et al., 1994 ). Our observations
suggest one of two things. First, it could be that someWord Reading160 140 120 100 80 60 40Nonword Reading130

123children with autism have difﬁculty applying phonological
decoding strategies. Numerous ﬁndings point to a rela-
tionship between difﬁculties in the phonological domainand poor nonword reading (e.g., Bishop, Adams, &
Norbury, 2004 ; Rack, Snowling, & Olson, 1992 ). Difﬁ-
culties with oral language are not rare in populations ofchildren with ASD and according to Tager-Flusberg and
colleagues (Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg, 2001 ; Tager-
Flusberg & Joseph, 2003 ) approximately 50 %of children
with ASD show language deﬁcits, including impairments
in phonological processing (as indexed by poor nonword
repetition for example). Potentially therefore, impairmentsin oral language may underlie the difﬁculties that some
children in our sample had with poor nonword reading.
Unfortunately however, we did not measure phonologicalprocessing but a reasonable prediction would be that those
children with poorest phonological skills would show
greatest difﬁculty with nonword reading. Alternatively (oradditionally), the relative advantage of word reading over
nonword reading observed in our study may be attribut-
able to some children utilising rote memorisation or visualassociation strategies when reading. Clearly, such a
strategy would assist word reading, but not nonword
reading. Potentially, this pattern of reading may beencouraged or confounded by literacy instruction. Our
anecdotal experience suggests that for some children with
autism, reading instruction is more focussed on the onrepetition of familiar materials rather than more phonic-
based reading strategies.
The high levels of poor reading comprehension seen in
this study are consistent with the view that hyperlexia is
associated with autism (e.g., Grigorenko et al., 2002 ).
Unfortunately however, the deﬁnition of hyperlexia remainsunclear (Grigorenko et al., 2003 ; Nation, 1999 ). While the
central feature of hyperlexia is word reading accuracy skills
in advance of reading comprehension, several other featureshave been described including an unusual preoccupation
with reading, very early (and sometimes spontaneous) onset
of word recognition and a general mismatch between pro-ﬁcient reading accuracy on the one hand and the presence of
cognitive and social deﬁcits on the other. Grigorenko et al.
(2003 ) recommended that the term hyperlexia be reserved
for those individuals with pervasive developmental disorder
who show all of these features of hyperlexia. They alsorecommended that the term ‘‘reading comprehension dis-
order’’ be adopted to describe those individuals (including
non-autistic children) who show a discrepancy betweenreading accuracy and reading comprehension, but do not
show the other features of hyperlexia. It is important for
future work to establish the validity of this view by com-paring children who show ‘hyperlexic reading’ but do or do
not show additional features such as unusual preoccupation
or early onset of reading ability. Only if there are signiﬁcantdifferences between the two groups will it become impor-
tant to make the distinction recommended by Grigorenko
et al. ( 2003 ). Until this issue is resolved and the deﬁnition of
hyperlexia clariﬁed, it is premature to estimate the inci-
dence of hyperlexia in our sample, especially as data
concerning preoccupation with reading and onset of readingare limited. Nevertheless, it is clear that poor reading
comprehension characterised the majority of children, and a
sizeable proportion showed poor reading comprehensiondespite achieving adequate levels of reading accuracy.
Our data serve to highlight that reading is not a unitary
construct and that component skills may dissociate in casesof developmental disorder. In our sample of children, we
identiﬁed children with poor reading comprehension and
children with poor nonword reading, relative to wordreading ability. This observation offers a cautionary note
for the assessment of reading in this population. Put sim-
ply, reliance on tests of word recognition is likely to over-estimate children’s reading competence in other areas,
most notably reading comprehension skills, but for some
children, decoding ability too. Very clearly, good or evenprecocious word reading ability does not guarantee ade-
quate reading comprehension. While it is clear that aspects
of reading may be a relative strength in some children withASD, and may even serve as a tool for educational inter-
vention (e.g., Williams, Wright, Callaghan, & Coughlan,
2002 ), it is important for both research and practice that the
heterogeneous pattern of reading skills in children with
autism is recognised.

Autism spectrum disorder is a term used to describe a constellation of early-appearing social communication deficits 
and repetitive sensory–motor behaviours associated with a strong genetic component as well as other causes. The outlook for many individuals with autism spectrum disorder today is brighter than it was 50 years ago; more people with the condition are able to speak, read, and live in the community rather than in institutions, and some will be largely free from symptoms of the disorder by adulthood. Nevertheless, most individuals will not work full-time or live independently. Genetics and neuroscience have identified intriguing patterns of risk, but without much practical benefit yet. Considerable work is still needed to understand how and when behavioural and medical treatments can be effective, and for which children, including those with substantial comorbidities. It is also important to implement what we already know and develop services for adults with autism spectrum disorder. Clinicians can make a difference by providing timely and individualised help to families navigating referrals and access to community support systems, by providing accurate information despite often unfiltered media input, and by anticipating transitions such as family changes and school entry and leaving.
Introduction
In the past 50 years, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has gone from a narrowly defined, rare disorder of childhood onset to a well publicised, advocated, and researched lifelong condition, recognised as fairly common and very heterogeneous. The description of the core features of ASD as being social communication deficits and repetitive and unusual sensory–motor behaviours has not changed substantially since its original delineation.
1 
However, autism is now seen as a spectrum that can range from very mild to severe. Nevertheless, many (but not all) individuals with ASD require lifelong support of some kind.
Although families, teachers, and direct providers 
make the most differences to the lives of people with ASD, physicians and other clinicians also affect individuals and families by providing information about the current functioning of the person with ASD, by helping caregivers to anticipate transitions, and by navigating referrals to service providers and specialists when needed. ASD represents a substantial economic burden, mainly due to the provision of support to adults who cannot function independently, which results in higher health-care and school costs and loss of income for caregivers.
2 This Seminar focuses on summarising 
current research so that clinicians can provide guidance to families within the context of ASD, recognising that, although ASD is a biological disorder, it is primarily treated through education and behavioural services, with medication as an important adjunct.
Signs, symptoms, and general diagnostic issues
Although individuals with ASD are very different from one another, the disorder is characterised by core features in two areas—social communication and restricted, repetitive sensory–motor behaviours—irrespective of culture, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group.
3 ASD results from early 
altered brain development and neural reorganisation.4,5 
However, because there are no reliable biomarkers, the diagnosis must be made on the basis of behaviour. The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 criteria,
6 
published in 2013, were intended to make the diagnosis of ASD more straightforward. There is now a single ASD spectrum based on the two domains (social communi
 cation, and restricted, repetitive, or unusual Published Online

Search strategy and selection criteria
Initial searches were done on Aug 14, 15, and 17, 2017 . Additional searches were done on 
Feb 21–23 and March 18–21, 2018. Searches were limited to the English language. To identify studies for this Seminar, we searched PubMed and individually searched the Cochrane database, and followed back by searching reference lists of papers cited in major journals for papers published between 2007 and 2017, using the search terms “autism behavioral treatment”, “autism diagnosis”, “autism environmental factors”, “autism epidemiology”, “autism incidence”, “autism prevalence”, “autism risk factors”, “autism spectrum disorder behavioral treatment”, “autism spectrum disorder diagnosis”, “autism spectrum disorder environmental factors”, “autism spectrum disorder epidemiology”, “autism spectrum disorder incidence”, “autism spectrum disorder risk factors”, “autistic disorder behavioral treatment”, “autistic disorder diagnosis”, “autistic disorder environmental factors”, “autistic disorder epidemiology”, “autistic disorder incidence”, “autistic disorder prevalence”, “autistic disorder risk factors”, “Asperger’s syndrome behavioral treatment”, “Asperger’s syndrome diagnosis”, environmental factors”, “Asperger’s syndrome epidemiology”, “Asperger’s syndrome incidence”, “Asperger’s syndrome prevalence”, “Asperger’s syndrome risk factors”, “Asperger’s disorder behavioral treatment”, “Asperger’s disorder diagnosis”, “Asperger’s disorder environmental factors”, “Asperger’s disorder epidemiology”, “Asperger’s disorder prevalence”, “Asperger’s disorder risk factors”, “pervasive developmental disorder behavioral treatment”, “pervasive developmental disorder diagnosis”, “pervasive developmental disorder environmental factors”, “pervasive developmental disorder epidemiology”, “pervasive developmental disorder incidence”, “pervasive developmental disorder prevalence”, “pervasive developmental disorder risk factors”, “PDD-NOS behavioral treatment”, “PDD-NOS diagnosis”, “PDD-NOS environmental factors”, “PDD-NOS epidemiology”, “PDD-NOS incidence”, “PDD-NOS prevalence”, “PDD-NOS risk factors”. Only articles published in English were included. We also examined key recent reviews and book chapters. To reduce the number of papers cited, the most up-to-date review papers and meta-analyses were used when possible. We selected papers according to our judgment of the quality of the study or review paper, the relevance to controversial or commonly misunderstood issues, and whether findings had clinical relevance. We included older papers that we judged to be important.Seminar2 www.thelancet.com   Published online August 2, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2University, New York State

sensory–motor behaviours). Subtypes such as Asperger’s 
disorder and pervasive develop  mental disorder not 
otherwise specified, which were unreliably used by clin -
icians, are now consolidated under the single diagnosis of ASD. In addition, DSM-5 explicitly recognises that ASD can be accompanied by other disorders, including genetic
 
disorders (eg, fragile X syndrome) and psychiatric conditions (eg, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]).
To be diagnosed with ASD, a person must show evidence 
of difficulties, past or present, in each of three social communication subdomains, and must have or have had difficulty in two of the four different restricted, repetitive sensory–motor behaviours (panel 1). There are also newly proposed levels of severity in DSM-5 based on the need for 
support, which so far have shown dubious validity, although the concept of functionality is in itself very important.

Questions about screening
Issues related to screening and subsequent diagnosis, both for families and providers, are often different for very young children than for older children, adolescents, and adults, and therefore will be discussed separately. There are no data from well controlled studies about the extent to which early intervention changes adult outcomes, and it is generally not possible to measure the factors that predict later outcomes (eg, language development or cognitive level) at the ages proposed for early screening (18–30 months). Many public health systems have attempted to identify very young children with ASD in general populations. However, to date, screening methods have typically not been sufficiently sensitive in that they have not identified most children with ASD in general populations in whom parents have not already noticed a delay.
10
When parents have expressed a concern to a family 
member, friend, or professional, screening instruments become more predictive for children as young as 18 months of age.
11 Even then, when parents ask for 
help, referrals are often not made.12 A range of screening 
instruments work well when someone—parent or professional—is concerned that a child might have ASD, the most common of which are the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and, less commonly, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS).
13 Almost all children identified by these 
screening instruments have developmental difficulties, although not all have ASD.
13 A survey14 showed that 
children with ASD who had consistent sources of paediatric care, frequent contact with grandmothers, and older siblings, received earlier diagnoses than did children with no siblings. Children with ASD who had a younger sibling close in age had the most delayed diagnoses.
15 Thus, many approaches can lead to 
earlier diagnoses: in addition to screening instruments, strategies include increasing awareness of ASD in the family and community, promoting belief that there is value in getting a diagnosis, facilitating relationships between specialists and primary-care providers to provide screening and make referrals, and improving access to services.Panel 1: Signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder as described in DSM-5 (299.0)6

ASD can be diagnosed by various professionals (paedia -
tricians, psychiatrists, or psychologists), ideally with 
input from multiple disciplines. Standardised diag  nostic 
instru  ments are available, including the Screening Tool 
for Autism in T
oddlers and Young Children (STAT; 
a 20-min observation for young children) and the more heavily researched Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS;
16 a 45-min observation done by a skilled 
professional, available in different formats for people of different language levels and ages, from 12 months to adulthood). These instruments allow the clinician, in the company of the caregiver, to observe and characterise the particular behaviours of the individual suspected to have ASD. For research or a more comprehensive develop
-
mental history, caregiver interviews such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview-R
evised (ADI-R) or, particularly in 
the UK, the Diagnostic Instrument for Social Communi -
cation Disorders (DISCO), or the computer-generated Develop
 mental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview 
(3di) are used, with many clinicians relying on informal histories.
17,18 Assessment of children’s symptoms can be 
obtained from a variety of scales, such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Social Communication Question
-
naire (SCQ). Adaptive scales are also often used as measures of everyday functioning.
16 Obtaining infor -
mation about receptive and expressive language level, general behavioural difficulties, and motor skills, including an estimate of cognitive functioning or IQ, is considered standard practice.
19
Diagnoses based on combined clinician observation 
and caregiver reports are consistently more reliable than those based on either observation or reports alone; therefore, clinicians should not rely solely on either parent reports or instruments such as the ADOS.
20 
Children who do not have language delays, or who are female, of ethnic minorities, of low socioeconomic status, or from families not fluent in English (at least in the USA) often receive later diagnoses.
21
ASD differs from many other medical conditions in 
that the family’s reactions to the child and the diagnosis affect the child’s outcome as much as any specific treatment does.
22 Providing information to family 
members about resources, even if the next steps are not straightforward, is as important as any diagnostic labels, including ASD and other disorders, that might be applied to the child. Follow-up from a key professional is needed for families, especially at transition points such as diagnosis, school entry and leaving, and family changes. Helping a family to find a child’s initial formal treatment is just the first step in what will be many levels of care and many decision points.
Diagnosis, ASD, and intellectual disability
One source of tension regarding the provision of straightforward and simple recommendations for ASD diagnosis and services is the heterogeneity across regions and ages in the association between ASD and intellectual disabilities. Because very young children with clear developmental disabilities are likely to receive referrals for treatment or specialist assessment earlier 
than those without, care should be taken not to overlook very verbal young children with ASD.
21 Clear predictions 
of later intellectual disabilities, except in children with profound delays, are not usually possible in children aged 2–3  years referred for possible ASD. Among preschool children in whom ASD is a concern, many but not all (or, in some countries, not most) will have an intellectual disability as well.
23 Statistics vary 
tremendously, with 11–65% of school-age children with ASD reported as having intellectual disabilities (IQ <70).
24,25 Populations of children in different clinics 
and research samples can be quite dissimilar, and variation among adults can be even more pronounced, as self-advocates for ASD are often articulate individuals who are in very different circumstances than are people with dual diagnoses of ASD and intellectual disability. Such variation can be confusing for families who do not know what the future will hold for their young children. Therefore, it is important for clinicians and families to know about cognitive and language abilities for children as they grow older and to discuss these issues, as well as to recognise that the relationship between IQ and ASD differs in different populations and at different ages.
Diagnosis in older children and adolescents
For older children (ie, those in later primary school), adolescents, or adults whose families suspect that they might have ASD, questions about diagnosis are different because the individual often already has a history of difficulties.
26 Even though the majority of children 
with ASD in northern Europe and North America are diagnosed by early school age, there remain others who have never had a diagnosis.
27 Later diagnoses often occur 
in the context of co-occurring problems such as anxiety, hyperactivity, or mood disorders
22 that might have either 
exacerbated or masked the ASD, along with the same factors (female sex, ethnicity, multilingualism, socio
-
economic factors, and more advanced language) that play a part in delayed diagnoses in younger children. Assess
-
ments of these children need the same ASD-specific clinician observations and caregiver reports as for younger children, with information about speech, language, motor
, 
verbal and non-verbal cognitive, and adaptive skills, but also require attention to relevant psychiatric disorders. Several self-report instruments for ASD and other disorders are available, but their validity is questionable because of their low specificity.
28–30
ASD in adulthood
Estimates vary, but 10–33% of adults with ASD do not use more than simple phrases and have verbal and non-verbal IQs in the range of intellectual disability, requiring very Seminar4 www.thelancet.com   Published online August 2, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2substantial support.21,26,31 Most adults with ASD with 
intellectual disability can speak at some level, can take 
care of basic needs, and have the ability to work, but need daily support. Premature mortality is increased, primarily in individuals with lower intellectual abilities and in women (mostly resulting from congenital abnormalities and neurological disorders), but also in more able people with comorbid diagnoses.
32,33
In a community sample (ie, not a clinic sample), about 
a third of adults who were diagnosed with ASD as children and had average or higher intelligence no longer had obvious ASD features, although many had minor psychiatric conditions.
34 Thus, there is a wide 
range of adult outcomes. However, finding appropriate employment and services is difficult. Although a study published in 2013 showed that educational attainments had improved compared with 20 years earlier,
35 employ -
ment did not 
generally match levels of education. In 
terms of independence, in the USA, only about 25% of individuals with ASD with average intelligence live in their own households,
34 with the remainder living with 
their families into at least middle age. Marriage and long-term intimate relationships are still rare. The proportion of people with at least one reciprocal friendship in the past 20 years increases during childhood and adolescence 
for more able individuals with ASD, but remains lower than that in the general population.
35 However, we have 
almost no knowledge of characteristics of adults with ASD outside the USA and Europe.
Adults seeking first diagnoses of ASD typically are 
not intellectually disabled and often have comorbid psychiatric conditions.
31 Notably, the proportion of adults 
formally diagnosed with ASD after attending an ASD clinic is lower than that of children; this is perhaps because people with the clearest ASD symptoms have already been diagnosed.
31 Brief self-report measures do 
not have adequate specificity, but versions of the ADOS, the 3di, and the SRS are appropriate for verbally fluent adults.
36–38 Other general psychiatric diagnostic measures 
and a developmental history from relatives, if approved by the patient, can be helpful,
39 and a general cognitive 
assessment including verbal and non-verbal scores is also important. There is concern that women are under
-
diagnosed and diagnosed 
later because of the belief that 
ASD primarily occurs in male individuals or because it is masked by female gender-related social differences.
40 
Co-occurring difficulties (eg, depression or severe anxiety) can cause as much impairment as ASD features.
39
Several self-advocacy and identity movements are 
associated with ASD. These movements generally emphasise respect for neurodiversity, strengths (such as attention to detail), and individual differences, and have called for ASD to be considered a condition rather than a disorder. By contrast, parents of less able people with ASD have expressed concern that the predominant media focus on the most intelligent individuals with ASD, and the argument to consider ASD as an aspect of neurodiversity, downplays the impairments of those children and adults with the greatest needs and diminishes the importance of their voices also being heard.
41
Co-occurring psychiatric conditions in ASD
Clinicians have long been aware that ASD is often accompanied by other difficulties. In addition to ASD, the earliest considerations are usually developmental delay or intellectual disability, and language and motor difficulties. DSM-5 recognises this complexity by allowing multiple diagnoses, even within psychiatry, such as ASD and ADHD.
ADHD is the most common comorbidity in people 
with ASD (28·2% [95% CI 13·3–43·0]),
42 and considerably 
affects outcomes in children with ASD who have average intelligence or intellectual disability.
43 How ADHD affects 
children and adults changes over time in terms of interactions with executive functioning, peer relations, and depression, and should therefore be monitored.
43
Anxiety in various different forms—including social 
anxiety, generalised anxiety, separation anxiety in younger children, and phobias—also affects many children with ASD.
42,44 Anxiety and depression are more common, or at 
least more observable, in verbally fluent individuals, and increase during adolescence in girls, while also occurring in a substantial minority of boys.
45
Irritability and aggression are more common in 
ASD (25%) than in other developmental disorders (eg, idiopathic intellectual disability), although they take many different forms from minor physical aggression in very young children to verbal aggression in adults.
46
Trajectories and predictors of outcome
The range of outcomes, from individuals who remain non-verbal to those able to work and live independently without continuing ASD symptoms, greatly increases uncertainty for families and pressure on parents to get the most out of each intervention. Diagnoses of ASD can be made in children as young as 15–24 months in some cases, although these early diagnoses should be monitored closely.
47 The greatest gains, even into adulthood, are made 
by children who have begun to make progress in language and have about average non-verbal skills by 3 years of age.
48 Changes in language after age 5 years tend to be 
linear; changes before that age can include more dramatic shifts in trajectories that result in catching up to overall age-group average levels,
48 whereas those who do not catch 
up can be identified as having intellectual disabilities.
By age 9 years, friendship and engagement with peers, 
often associated with access to integrated school pro
  grammes, predicts adult outcome in terms of indepen -
dence and decreased 
symptoms, as do stronger adaptive 
skills.49 In a longitudinal study,34 parent partici  pation in 
early intervention for children between 2 and 3 years of age, even in as few as 20 sessions in a year
, consistently 
predicted more positive adult outcomes in terms of increased IQ (d=0·5), achievement (d=0·33), and adaptive Seminarwww.thelancet.com   Published online August 2, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2  5skills (d=0·27) in both less cognitively able and more 
cognitively able young adults (mean age 19 years), and also increased the probability of full independence in more able individuals, although this could reflect parent motivation and resources as much as treatment.
34
Descriptive epidemiology
A 2012 review commissioned by WHO estimated that the global prevalence of ASD was about 1%,
50 with a more 
recent review estimating the prevalence to be 1·5% in developed countries.
51 Increases in prevalence estimates 
in the USA over the past several decades have now mostly plateaued
21 and probably can be largely accounted for by 
improved awareness and services, differences in documentation, and the inclusion of milder cases without intellectual disability.
52 Only two rigorous studies 
of adult epidemiology of ASD have been done, both in the UK, and also provided estimates of about 1%, with many adults never having received a formal diagnosis.
28,39
Environmental risk factors
Many risk factors for ASD have been suggested. A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have described prenatal and perinatal factors, as well as maternal dietary and lifestyle factors.
53 The immediate 
practical implications of most environmental factors for families hoping to minimise their risk with a subsequent child (after already having a child with ASD) are so far limited to the identification of likely-causal genetic anomalies in a minority of cases.
Advanced maternal age (≥40 years) and paternal age 
(≥50 years)
54 have been independently associated with 
ASD risk in several studies,51 as have short inter-
pregnancy intervals (<24 months).55 Non-specific non-
optimal factors during pregnancy, including maternal metabolic conditions, weight gain, and hypertension, as well as more specific factors (such as maternal admission to hospital due to bacterial or viral infections, or familial 
history of autoimmune disease) have also been associated with a mildly increased risk of ASD and developmental delay combined.
56
Several studies have investigated maternal medication 
use during pregnancy. Prenatal valproic acid exposure has been associated with increased risk of ASD.
57 For 
antidepressants, including selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, well controlled studies
51,58 have suggested no 
unequivocal risk, despite earlier concerns.
Preterm birth (<32 weeks), low birthweight (<1500 g), 
small-for-gestational-age status,59 and large-for-gestational-
age status (>95th birthweight percentile)60 have been 
independently associated with an increased risk of ASD, although whether these factors are causal or markers of risk is unclear.
51 Nevertheless, these children should be 
monitored for ASD during later infancy and early toddler years. No consistent associations between caesarean delivery or assisted conception and risk of ASD have been found.
51Preconceptual folic acid supplements have been 
associated with a decreased risk of ASD and general developmental disabilities, with a significant gene–environment interaction.
61 Some links with air pollutants 
and maternal stressors during pregnancy have been found, but variable methods and results across countries make interpretations difficult.
51 Associations between 
ASD and vaccinations have been sought multiple times and not found.
62
ASD and paediatric conditions
ASD is strongly associated with numerous coexisting conditions—physical, mental, neurodevelopmental, and functional—that are not part of the diagnostic criteria but can nevertheless have a substantial, often negative, effect on the wellbeing of the child or young person and their family, and can require modification of intervention strategies. Coexisting conditions vary in prevalence de
-
pen ding on the population studied, but include other 
neuro  developmental disorders, intellectual disability 
(IQ <70; prevalence 15–65% for different samples),24,63 and 
academic learning difficulties (75% of individuals aged 
9–18 years with ASD had at least one area of literacy or mathematical achievement highly discrepant from their general intellectual ability, with reading comprehension most often being low).
64,65 The prevalence of speech and 
language delays is estimated to be 87% in 3-year-old children with ASD.
66,67 Other conditions include tics (in 9% 
of preschool and school-age children),42 sleeping problems 
(25–40%),68,69 restricted and rigid food choices (42–61%),70 
obesity (23%),71 gastrointestinal symptoms (47%),72 and 
elimination problems, particularly bowel evacuation and constipation (12%).
73 Epilepsy has a reported prevalence of 
8·6% in people with ASD and is particularly associated with intellectual disability and female sex.
74 Common 
coexisting conditions (eg, problems with sleeping, picky eating, and toileting) should be systematically investigated and treated; often, approaches like those used for children without ASD can be used and are similarly effective in children with ASD, although somewhat more creativity and persistence is needed.
Genetics
The past decade has seen a shift from a general concept of genetic risk to more specific attention to a large number of heterogeneous, individual genetic variants associated with ASD risk. The shifting definitions of ASD have led to variable rates of diagnosis in twin and family studies. A meta-analysis published in 2016 reported that 74–93% of ASD risk is heritable,
75 although 
non-genetic factors are also important. Sibling studies indicate that ASD occurs in 7–20% of subsequent children after an older child is diagnosed with ASD,
76,77 
and this prevalence is increased in children with two older siblings with ASD. Risk is 3–4-times higher in boys than girls.
78 Models of genetic risk in ASD 
favour complex inheritance, with additive contributions Seminar6 www.thelancet.com   Published online August 2, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2from common variants that individually make small 
contributions to risk,79 as well as rare variants that have 
larger effect sizes but are still not deterministic causes of ASD.
80 Relative to rare variants, common risk variants 
have been difficult to identify because of overlap with the general population.
The first evidence for specific genetic risk factors in 
ASD arose in rare genetic syndromes, such as fragile X syndrome
81 and tuberous sclerosis,82 which include 
ASD in some children. However, the most common of these syndromes, fragile X syndrome, is present in less than 2% of children with ASD. Genomic copy-number variants, in which a chromosomal subregion is duplicated or deleted, can be inherited or occur de novo (ie, in the child but not in either parent). In ASD, copy-number variants are best considered as risk variants rather than causal mutations, because most lead to ASD in a minority of children and can also be found in people with other developmental disorders or without any diagnosis. A few variants are common enough that their associated features have been individually studied, such as chromosome 16p11.2 deletions and duplications
83 and 
maternal 15q11–q13 duplications.84
In the past 15 years, recurrent, de-novo, likely gene-
disrupting, single-nucleotide variants have been identified in more than 100 genes, some of which also harbour rare, inherited single-nucleotide variants that appear to contribute to ASD risk.
85 The most common 
gene disrupted by these rare, de-novo events is CHD8,86 
although such variants are found in less than 0·5% of children with ASD. The collection of implicated genes seems to be enriched for certain biological functions including neuronal function and regulation of gene expression, suggesting common pathways that lead to ASD risk.
87,88
Many physician organisations now recommend that 
every child with ASD receive genetic testing, including fragile X syndrome testing and a chromosomal micro
-
array to detect 
copy-number variants.89 Some clinicians 
in North America and Europe already order whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing for children without chromosomal microarray findings. Sequencing could soon become the standard of care for ASD in some countries. Although testing can be ordered by any physician, referral to a specialist such as a clinical geneticist is typically indicated for children with specific genomic findings.
Currently, genetic testing has the potential to improve 
family planning (and provide a medical explanation for a child’s ASD in some cases), trigger screening for co-occurring medical problems, aid prognostication, and connect families to specific support groups. Treatment studies are underway in some children with genetically defined syndromes, such as fragile X syndrome. Within the next decade, we expect that genetic research will allow the development of new treatments for some children.
85Neurobiology
In neurobiology, ASD is no longer viewed as a focal impairment in a specific brain region or system, but instead as a condition resulting from overall brain re
-
organis  ation beginning early in development. Among the 
most well replicated findings is a pattern of overgrowth of brain volume in infancy and early childhood, as
 
documented through differences in brain volume on neuroimaging.
90,91 Relative to typically developing children, 
those with ASD have accelerated brain development early in life, which results in altered connectivity.
92 Connectivity 
is a broad concept encompassing physical inter -
connections as well as correlations or causal interactions in activity of different regions. Findings are generally
 
consistent in showing a pattern of overall brain under-connectivity, coupled with local over-connectivity within specific regions,
5,93 often the frontal and occipital regions. 
Given that the underlying cellular mechanisms for these neural patterns in early development are yet to be understood, we do not have strong evidence for how altered connectivity differentially affects specific brain regions, measurements (eg, brain volume [grey vs white matter], cortical thickness, gyrification), and conditions (eg, recording parameters or tasks).
5,91
Research on altered brain development and functioning 
has further elucidated differences in sensitivity to the environment and distinct styles of learning, which in turn lead to brain reorganisation during development, resulting in heterogeneous profiles in adults with ASD. Subtle alterations in multiple brain systems subserving social and attentional mechanisms are observed well before the emergence of overt behavioural symptoms.
94 
These alterations sometimes remain stable into adult -
hood, as different individuals use adaptive and compensatory mechanisms to address their challenges. Although it was hoped that head circumference might offer an informative biomarker for measuring individual variation in brain growth over time, it has been shown to have little usefulness as a predictor of ASD.
95 Given the 
complexity and uncertain nature of the causes of ASD, there is a need to provide families and other caregivers, especially around the time of diagnosis, with accurate information about biological differences that might underlie their child’s behaviour or different styles of learning.
Treatment
How much and what kind of intervention children and adults with ASD receive vary immensely across the world and even within countries and regions.
94 One consistent 
finding across many (although not all) locations is that parents with a lower educational level are less successful in obtaining specialist interventions that could improve outcomes. In one survey about European services for less well educated families, even low-cost and publicly funded interventions were not available to children until a year after diagnosis.
96Seminarwww.thelancet.com   Published online August 2, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2  7Early parent-mediated interventions
Several well designed randomised controlled trials have 
shown that low-intensity interventions that coach parents on how to interact with their young children with ASD can result in immediate effects on children’s social behaviour and communication.
16 These treatments 
emphasise teaching parents and caregivers to establish joint engagement, avoid being very directive, and create opportunities for shared attention and balanced play so that children gradually take more initiative.
16 The 
treatments can also help, to some degree, to alleviate the distress of families and give them something positive to focus on.
97
These treatments tend to be non-intrusive for families, 
relatively low in cost, adaptable for the clinic or home and for groups or individuals, and could be helpful even for families of very young at-risk children who, in the end, might not develop ASD but have other delays. Formal treatments that fit into the category of early parent-mediated interventions are listed in panel 2. All have shown some effectiveness, with variations in intensity and duration (effect sizes for early parent-mediated interventions are typically around d=0·30).
98 
One paper showed these that the benefits of these interventions lasted beyond early years and into later childhood (effect size 0·70).
103
However, other studies with similar low-intensity 
approaches (eg, More Than Words) have not shown positive results, and non-specific factors might influence the effects.
99,104 Furthermore, no formal studies have 
directly varied the intensity of interventions or contrasted one approach with another. Strategies that work for most children might not work for everyone; for children with severe delays who cannot yet play or manipulate objects well, teaching their parents to avoid initiating play or other interactions might not be helpful.
66 Similarly, 
although most children learn words first receptively and then expressively, children with substantial delays might learn words first by saying them and then come to understand them.
66 Thus, not all children with ASD will 
benefit from the same approaches.
Naturalistic behavioural developmental interventions
The treatment that has received the most attention historically in North America has been early intensive behavioural intervention. The most well known form of this treatment is Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), but there are many versions of this approach. A 2015 review
100 summarised the research on these approaches 
and introduced the term naturalistic developmental be -
havioural inter  ventions (NDBI), which includes Pivotal 
R
esponse Treatment (PRT), Early Start Denver Model 
(ESDM), Joint Attention Symbolic Play and Engagement Regulation (JASPER), and Early Social Interaction (ESI) (panel 2). These treatments differ from one another but share similarities in that they follow typical develop
-
mental sequences more closely as compared with the Panel 2: Early parent-mediated treatments and early 
naturalistic developmental behavioural interventions with evidence for treatment, and parent-friendly online resources

interaction, and communicative initiation on the part of the child, and natural consequences as opposed to rewards such as food. These treatments are generally undertaken by an adult teacher or therapist working one-to-one with a child, using principles of learning to teach a child developmental skills such as language, imitation, or cognitive tasks such as matching or sorting. The treatment is usually intended to be given intensively in periods of 15–20 h or more per week. Meta-analyses of treatment studies
16,105 report effect 
sizes of d=0·69 for adaptive skills, d=0·76 for IQ, and about d=0·50 for language skills after 2 years of treatment; however, only one trial was truly randomised and all studies compared the NDBIs to a treatment-as-usual control group. When NDBI approaches have been directly compared with other developmental approaches of equal intensity, no difference has been found.
16 Another commonly used treatment that also 
uses modified behavioural techniques is TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children and Adults),
106 which is a way of 
using the temporal and physical environment to increase independence, communication, and predictability, often within a classroom setting.
Overall, parent-mediated interventions primarily affect 
social communication interaction and sometimes ASD symptoms over time; one-to-one (adult and child) intensive interventions based on NDBI or ABA have been shown to affect language development, cognition, and adaptive skills, perhaps because they are usually more intense, structured treatments. Children might benefit in different ways from both social communication-oriented parent-mediated interventions and direct one-to-one treatments from therapists or teachers;
107 however, we do 
not yet have research to guide these decisions.
Many other interventions are available to children with 
ASD, some routinely through schools or health systems and some sought out by parents. Although specific techniques within speech therapy have general empirical support, it has been difficult to show that speech therapy and occupational therapy are effective, in part because they represent many different treatments. In general, techniques in speech therapy have been shown to increase spoken single-word acquisition and improve simple sentence structure, but shown no effects on complex language so far.
107
Sensory-oriented treatments are a considerable part 
of early interventions and school-based treatments in North America, but are less so in other countries. A small amount of research literature is accumulating, with the same limitations as other behavioural studies in terms of small samples and various risks of biases. Sensory-integration approaches delivered by occupational therapists improved sensory and motor skills in the short term (d=0·12 to d=1·2 for teacher and parent ratings and sensory evaluations) compared with usual care in young children.
108 Auditory-integration treatments have not 
yielded consistently positive results. Music therapy results have been generally positive, although limitations in the study designs mean that conclusions should be made with caution. General environmental stimulation improved cognitive skills in two small-scale studies. Various sensory-related components (eg, weighted blankets, swings, or brushing) have not shown consistent positive effects, except perhaps massage (d=0·6 to d=0·7 for self-regulation and sensory responses).
109
Behavioural and social treatments for school-age 
children, adolescents, and adults
For school-age children and adolescents, the most 
common behavioural interventions are social skills groups. Numerous highly manualised programmes in which children, adolescents, and parents participate separately and together have been shown to result in improvements in social behaviour (d=0·98 for self-reported social skills; d=0·58 for tasks; smaller effects for parent and teacher reports) in randomised controlled studies.
110 A variety of other manualised programmes 
emphasise different components, such as executive functioning, theory of mind, and more comprehensive approaches, such as SCERTS (Social Communication/Emotional Regulation/Transactional Support), with less strong empirical support.
111 Social stories (a strategy in 
which a caregiver depicts an anticipated or experienced event in cartoons and the child and adult then discuss it) have also been shown to reduce disruptive behaviour.
112
Many of these programmes use cognitive behavioural 
therapy as their underlying theoretical framework. A number of group therapy programmes have aimed to reduce anxiety symptoms in children with ASD, usually with parallel parents’ and children’s groups.
113,114 The 
frequency of anxiety symptoms in ASD attests to the important need for such interventions.
42 These 
approaches usually last about 3 months and report quite high effect sizes (d>0·70), with about half of children in the therapy groups responding compared with less than 10% of those in control groups.
115 Effects of behavioural 
interventions on depression have been more difficult to document.
116
A manualised treatment called parent-child inter  action 
therapy increased shared positive affect and child adaptability
,117 consistent with the general finding that 
hands-on parent training reduces disruptive behaviour more than parent education alone (effect sizes d=–0·62 to d=0·70).
118 Interventions for aggression and 
oppositional disorders remain an underserved need for many families of children with ASD, and traditional behaviour management can help.
42 An ongoing debate is 
whether new behavioural descriptions, such as patho -
logical demand avoidance119 (a term of rising popularity 
in the UK), are helpful or harmful, particularly when they are primarily based on questionnaires or non-specific items from caregiver reports. There are many Seminarwww.thelancet.com   Published online August 2, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2  9unknowns about how best to consider the complexity of 
the associations between the deficits of ASD, emotional regulation, and existing diagnoses (such as oppositional defiant disorder) and other behavioural difficulties.
120
Few studies have investigated behavioural treatments 
in adults, except those for anxiety and depression discussed earlier. This area warrants more research, moving beyond cognitive behavioural therapy and social skills groups to include broader life skills and, for example, anger management and self-advocacy, as well as medical issues such as obesity.
19 Another area of 
focus has been how to increase employability in adults with ASD, with an emphasis on helping secondary school students and young adults to enter community-integrated programmes as soon as possible, rather than practising work in special workshops or schools.
121
Another area of concern is the disparity in services—in 
terms of availability, quality, and utilisation—across racial and ethnic groups and between families with different levels of educational and financial resources. Research showed that services such as family peer advocates (who focus on families’ involvement rather than a more medical or traditional therapeutic per
 spective) increase 
knowledge and decrease stress for underserved popu -
lations,122 but with no change in use of services. The 
increasing prevalence of ASD in the USA among diverse populations suggests improved identification of the disorder, but the same information is not available about the dissemination of treatments and educational approaches. Concerns about appropriate services and accurate diagnoses for girls and women with ASD have also received increasing attention recently. Although ASD is consistently more prevalent in male individuals, estimates of sex ratios vary markedly across populations,
50 
as do patterns of symptoms, interacting with differences in distributions of intelligence, motor skills, and known genetic factors.
117
Pharmacology
Evidence-based pharmacology in ASD is currently limited to the treatment of co-occurring behaviours or diagnoses, not ASD itself. Risperidone
123 and aripiprazole124 have 
improved symptoms of irritability or agitation in children and adolescents with ASD in randomised controlled trials. Overall, with use of these two medications, the majority of (but not all) children show improvement in irritability and agitation, which includes aggression, self-injury, and other disruptive behaviours.
125 Both drugs 
are mixed dopamine-receptor and serotonin-receptor antagonists or partial agonists, and are in a class commonly termed atypical antipsychotics. Not all similar medications are helpful in ASD.
126 Both drugs can also 
cause adverse events, including sedation and weight gain, increasing risk of later health problems. Metformin is helpful in ameliorating weight gain due to these medications in ASD.
127
A few medications typically used to treat ADHD, 
including methylphenidate,128 atomoxetine,129 and guan -
facine130 (table), also show benefit for ADHD symptoms 
in ASD, which occur in over a quarter of children.42 Each 
of these drugs yields less benefit and more adverse events in individuals with ASD than in the general ADHD population. The available studies suggest that these three drugs should be limited to use in children with ASD who have co-occurring ADHD, which is made as a separate diagnosis according to DSM-5.
Children with ASD and co-occurring epilepsy or other 
neurological disorders should be treated on the basis of evidence in children without ASD.
131 It is reasonable to 
similarly adapt evidence from the general paediatric population for the treatment of mental illnesses that co-occur with ASD, such as anxiety and mood disorders. To date, despite the frequent co-occurrence of epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders with ASD, no randomised controlled trials have evaluated whether medications for these co-occurring disorders show similar response rates or adverse events in people with ASD. Caution should therefore be used, with preference for lower-risk treatments, including behavioural or psychosocial interventions.
Some clinicians, including those who describe their 
practices as biomedical or holistic, prescribe various treatments that have no evidence and no biological plausibility in ASD.
132 A few supplements, such as 
sulforaphane133 and folic acid,134 have some biological 
plausibility and some pilot evidence, but further study is Age (years) for

with certain non-evidence-based treatments, such as toxicity due to chelating agents or hyperbaric oxygen.
135 
Clinicians should prevent these treatments from distracting or diverting resources from evidence-based behavioural or educational interventions.
Future directions
Given existing health systems, there are clear, continuing needs for coordination between health-care, education, and other services (such as intense support for challeng
-
ing behaviours and planning for adult residential and employment programmes for individuals with ASD). E
ven the immediate demand on physicians’ time for 
counselling and support of families facing potential early diagnoses is a controversy in the USA because these are generally not billable services for paediatricians. To date, scientific focus has primarily been on the development of more accurate tools for identification; however, using community resources to develop and promote use of more readily available treatment programmes in which young children and adults can participate might make more sense, because physicians are more likely to screen and refer when they perceive a benefit to the family from doing so. Economic data—such as a 2012 report that indicated that, in the USA, for every $1000 spent on respite care, there was an 8% decrease in spending on inpatient psychiatric services on Medicaid-enrolled children with ASD
136—could be helpful in justifying the 
cost of services such as respite care.
In basic science research, much has been learned; 
however, the clinical implications remain few, partly because of findings from both genetics and imaging studies that ASD is not typically caused by a specific gene or highly localised lesion, but might result from combined or not-yet-understood genetic risks and disruptions in very early developing neural pathways. Although the idea of continuous traits underlying ASD is appealing to many scientists, it should also be recognised that many of these traits, such as intelligence, language level, activity level, anxiety, motivation, and aggression, interact with each other in complex ways, and thus simple models do not represent actual development.
In terms of global health, focusing on the goals of 
children and adults with ASD and their families, rather than on how to plug gaps in existing systems, might help to set appropriate priorities. Innovative solutions, such as adaptations of evidence-based interventions for low-resource settings through empowering front-line health-care workers, are underway.

Conclusions
Life for many children and adults with ASD is improved today compared with 50 years ago. More adults with ASD can talk, read, drive, graduate from school, and live in the community—even accounting for the differences in which people would meet the diagnostic criteria now and in the past, and their respective levels of intelligence. Caregivers can be reassured that the situation has improved, and will continue to improve, for most people with ASD. We hope that research directs attention to individuals who still have substantial difficulties and provides pathways to fuller inclusion and greater independence for more people. Science and public policy both have the potential to contribute to such changes. Working with families, schools, and community providers, clinicians can make differences in the lives of individual children and adults by providing accurate and realistic infor
 mation, support, 
and hope.

Identiﬁcation and Evaluation of
Children With Autism SpectrumDisorders

ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorders are not rare; many primary care pediatricians care for
several children with autism spectrum disorders. Pediatricians play an importantrole in early recognition of autism spectrum disorders, because they usually are theﬁrst point of contact for parents. Parents are now much more aware of the earlysigns of autism spectrum disorders because of frequent coverage in the media; iftheir child demonstrates any of the published signs, they will most likely raise theirconcerns to their child’s pediatrician. It is important that pediatricians be able torecognize the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders and have astrategy for assessing them systematically. Pediatricians also must be aware of localresources that can assist in making a deﬁnitive diagnosis of, and in managing,autism spectrum disorders. The pediatrician must be familiar with developmental,educational, and community resources as well as medical subspecialty clinics. Thisclinical report is 1 of 2 documents that replace the original American Academy ofPediatrics policy statement and technical report published in 2001. This reportaddresses background information, including deﬁnition, history, epidemiology,diagnostic criteria, early signs, neuropathologic aspects, and etiologic possibilitiesin autism spectrum disorders. In addition, this report provides an algorithm to helpthe pediatrician develop a strategy for early identiﬁcation of children with autismspectrum disorders. The accompanying clinical report addresses the managementof children with autism spectrum disorders and follows this report on page 1162[available at www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162]. Both clinical re-ports are complemented by the toolkit titled “ Autism: Caring for Children With
Autism Spectrum Disorders :A Resource Toolkit for Clinicians ,” which contains screening
and surveillance tools, practical forms, tables, and parent handouts to assist thepediatrician in the identiﬁcation, evaluation, and management of autism spectrumdisorders in children.
INTRODUCTION
Public and physician awareness of autism has increased markedly in the newmillennium because of increased media coverage and a rapidly expanding body ofknowledge published in professional journals. Professionals who specialize inautism have proliferated over the past 2 decades and have introduced the termi-nology “autism spectrum disorders” (ASDs) to reﬂect the broader spectrum ofclinical characteristics that now deﬁne autism.
1,2ASDs represent 3 of the pervasive
developmental disorders deﬁned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mentalwww.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/

doi:10.1542/peds.2007-2361
All clinical reports from the American
Academy of Pediatrics automatically expire5 years after publication unless reafﬁrmed,revised, or retired at or before that time.
The guidance in this report does not
indicate an exclusive course of treatmentor serve as a standard of medical care.Variations, taking into account individualcircumstances, may be appropriate.

4: autistic disorder
(AD), Asperger syndrome (AS [this terminology will beused in this report, although “Asperger’s disorder” isused in the aforementioned publications]), and perva-sive developmental disorder–not otherwise speciﬁed(PDD-NOS). In addition to being a spectrum disorder,autism has wide variability with respect to the presenceand intensity of symptoms, even within the DSM-IV-TRcategories, which indicates that there may be additionalsubtypes.
ASDs are not rare; many primary care pediatricians
(PCPs) care for several children with ASDs. In fact, asurvey completed in 2004 revealed that 44% of PCPsreported that they care for at least 10 children withASDs; however, only 8% stated that they routinelyscreened for ASDs.
5Another survey indicated that al-
though PCPs were aware of the current DSM-IV-TRdiagnostic criteria, they sometimes held beliefs aboutASDs that were outdated.
6It is critical that PCPs recog-
nize the early signs of ASDs and be aware of new datathat support better outcomes in children whose condi-tions are diagnosed early and who participate in appro-priate intervention programs.
7–11Because it is a chronic
condition, the PCP also needs to feel comfortable withthe ongoing care of children with ASDs within the con-text of the medical home. To support PCPs in the iden-tiﬁcation and care of children with ASD, the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) has developed and distrib-uted several documents:
●The “ Autism A .L.A.R.M.”12: a ﬂyer that highlights the
prevalence of autism, the importance of screening andlistening to parents’ concerns, and the urgency ofmaking simultaneous referrals to specialists in ASDsand early intervention programs to promote improvedoutcomes.
●“Is Your One -Year-Old Communicating With You? ”13:a
brochure that focuses on early identiﬁcation of socialcommunication deﬁcits and behavior problems thatmay be associated with developmental disorders, pri-marily ASDs. This brochure is intended for distribu-tion to all parents of infants at the 9- or 12-monthwell-child visit. It encourages parents to share anyconcerns they have about their infant’s language de-velopment and social skills with the pediatrician asearly as possible.
●“Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorders ”14: a 48-page
introductory booklet for parents of children in whoman ASD has been diagnosed recently or is suspectedstrongly.
In addition, the AAP has developed an ASD toolkit
and resource guide to assist the PCP with implementa-tion of the principles discussed herein.Although ASDs are neurodevelopmental conditions
with strong genetic underpinnings, their exact etiology isunknown. In 1943, Leo Kanner, a psychiatrist at JohnsHopkins University, ﬁrst described autism in a smallgroup of children who demonstrated extreme aloofnessand total indifference to other people.
15In 1944, Hans
Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician who was unaware ofKanner’s work, published an article
16that described chil-
dren who demonstrated symptoms similar to those ofKanner’s patients, with the exception that verbal andcognitive skills were higher. The term “infantile autism”ﬁrst appeared as a diagnostic label in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-
III).
17Since then, terminology has changed and diagnos-
tic criteria have broadened.18Diagnostic criteria for AS
were not included in the DSM until the fourth edition(DSM-IV). The most recent criteria for AD and AS (As-perger’s disorder) are found in the DSM-IV-TR
4(Tables 1
and 2, respectively). PDD-NOS, the remaining ASD, isdescribed in the DSM-IV-TR as a subthreshold diagnosticterm used when a child demonstrates severe and perva-sive impairments in reciprocal social skills associatedwith deﬁcits in language skills or with the presence ofstereotypic behaviors or restricted interests or activitiesbut does not meet full criteria for AD or AS. AlthoughRett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder areincluded in the DSM-IV-TR listings, they are not consid-ered ASDs but should be considered in the differentialdiagnosis of each child, depending on the presentingsigns and symptoms.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Authors of studies published early in the new millen-nium concluded that the best estimate of current prev-alence of ASDs in Europe and North America is approx-imately 6 per 1000.
19–27In 2000, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention organized the Autism and De-velopmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, a multi-site, records-based surveillance program, to study theprevalence of ASDs. The network uses systematicscreening of developmental evaluation records for autis-tic behaviors rather than depending on a medical oreducational diagnostic label of an ASD. In 2007, thenetwork reported ASD rates for 8-year-old childrenranging from 1 in 303 to 1 in 94 for 2 time periods (2000and 2002) in a total of 14 sites in the United States; theaverage rate was 1 in 150 or 6.6 per 1000 8-year-olds.
28–31Although these studies reﬂect a 10-fold increase
from studies published a half-century ago that chieﬂytargeted AD alone, most of the newer studies also in-cluded individuals with AS and PDD-NOS. One of thefew studies that analyzed the prevalence in regard totype of ASD revealed that in Canada, where the overallrate was 6.5 per 1000, the individual rates were 2.2per 1000 for AD, 1.0 per 1000 for AS, and 3.3 per 1000for PDD-NOS.

cult.20–22,24,31–34
With recent heightened public awareness, parents are
more likely to raise a concern speciﬁcally about au-tism.
35–37In addition, as screening tools and more reliable
evaluation instruments have been developed, profes-sionals have become increasingly proﬁcient in recogniz-ing and diagnosing ASD. Apart from greater awarenessand better ascertainment, additional reasons for the ap-parent increase have been debated hotly in the lay me-dia; in fact, the publicized “autism epidemic” may be oneof the most challenging public health issues today.
The prevalence of autism and, more recently, ASDs is
closely linked to a history of changing criteria and diag-nostic categories. Autism ﬁrst appeared as a separate
entity with speciﬁc criteria in the DSM-III in 1980.
17In
1987, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R )38listed broadened
AD criteria and the new subthreshold category of PDD-NOS, both of which promoted inclusion of milder cases.Later, these changes received criticism for being tooinclusive and for promoting overdiagnosis.
39The DSM-
IV3criteria published in 1994 reﬂected the result of years
of analyses to reduce the overinclusiveness of the DSM-III-R criteria; however, it included AS for the ﬁrst time,which, in effect, broadened the range of disorders. Stud-ies have revealed that the DSM-IV criteria have betterspeciﬁcity (0.87) than DSM-III-R criteria.

on 08 May 2023TR4criteria for AD and AS are unchanged; however, the
text description of PDD-NOS was edited slightly to in-crease speciﬁcity. Collaboration with European groupsthat worked on the revised International Statistical Classi-
ﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th edi-
tion)
41promoted better conformity between the 2 clas-
siﬁcation systems.
AD did not become a diagnosis for which children
became eligible to receive special education services un-til passage of the Individuals With Disabilities EducationAct (IDEA) in 1990.
42Before the IDEA was enacted,
children were labeled as having conditions such as men-tal retardation (MR), learning disability, speech impair-ment, or emotional disturbance to obtain eligibility forservices.
43Hence, after passage of the IDEA, the resulting
increase in the number of children served under the ADcategory reﬂected both newly diagnosed young childrenentering the school system and older children who werepreviously eligible for special services under a differenteducational label. This reﬂects the phenomenon of “di-agnostic substitution,” whereby the number of childrenreceiving special education under other categories (pri-marily MR, speech impairment, and learning disabilities)has decreased over the same time period. In addition,some increase in prevalence may be attributable to in-accuracies in diagnosis for a number of reasons, includ-ing labeling biases when schools used less rigorous cri-teria than those needed for a DSM diagnosis,
44–48 when
educational funding trends inﬂuenced diagnosis,49
and/or when parents of children with marginal criteriaadvocated for the AD label to qualify for supplementaryservices (eg, year-round schooling) described in theIDEA amendments.
50,51The impact of these factors on
current prevalence estimates has been controversial andillustrates the reason why educational administrativedata reported in some studies that receive media atten-tion should not be considered for epidemiologic stud-ies.
47,48,52–56
Just at the time when school eligibility laws were
changing, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 199057
was passed, obliging states to administer their programsin the most integrated settings appropriate to the needsof the person with disabilities. This was the culminationof a long series of state and federal legislation that pro-moted closure of institutions and encouraged govern-ments to support families in their efforts to raise theirchildren with disabilities at home. Thus, children withautism, especially those with comorbid MR and behaviorproblems who might have been institutionalized in thepast, began to attend community schools and to be“counted” in educational prevalence data.
Other factors that may also be contributing to the
perceived increase in prevalence include the recent iden-tiﬁcation of children with genetic disorders unrelated toASDs who also sometimes can meet criteria for an ASD,such as Down syndrome
58,59and CHARGE (coloboma,heart disease, choanal atresia, retarded growth and de-
velopment and/or central nervous system anomalies,genital anomalies and/or hypogonadism, and ear anom-alies and/or deafness) syndrome.
60Finally, diagnosis of
an ASD may be made in an older family member withmilder symptoms that were previously unrecognizeduntil after the diagnosis of a younger child.
61
Regardless of the study, the year conducted, or the
reported rate of prevalence, more boys than girls areconsistently found to be affected with ASDs, with male-to-female ratios ranging from 2:1 to 6.5:1.
24,28,29,34,62 The
male-to-female ratio is even higher for high-functioningautism and AS, ranging from 6:1 to as high as 15:1.
63(In
recognition of these statistics and for the sake of brevity,this report uses masculine pronouns.)
ETIOLOGY
ASDs are biologically based neurodevelopmental disor-ders that are highly heritable.
64Despite this fact, the
exact cause still is unknown. Finding the cause has beendaunting because of genetic complexity and phenotypicvariation. ASDs are complex heritable disorders that in-volve multiple genes and demonstrate great phenotypicvariation. Estimates of recurrence risks, based on familystudies of idiopathic ASDs, are approximately 5% to 6%(range: 2%–8%) when there is an older sibling with anASD and even higher when there are already 2 childrenwith ASDs in the family.
65–68
In a minority of cases ( /H1102110%), ASDs may be associ-
ated with a medical condition or a known syndrome.20,21
Although ASDs are believed to be mainly genetic inorigin, environmental factors may modulate phenotypicexpression.
64,69Advanced paternal age70,71and maternal
age71,72have been shown to be associated with an in-
creased risk of having offspring with ASDs, possibly be-cause of de novo spontaneous mutations and/or alter-ations in genetic imprinting. Environmental exposuresmay act as central nervous system teratogens in earlygestational life.
73Some researchers have suggested that
an epigenetic mechanism (heritable changes in geneexpression that occur without changes in DNA se-quence) may be responsible.
74Thus, it has become more
and more apparent that the etiology is multifactorialwith a variety of genetic and, to a lesser extent, envi-ronmental factors playing a role.
75
Two major strategies have been used in the search for
the ASD genes: targeted cytogenetic/molecular studiesand whole-genome screens of families of children withASD.
76–79The ﬁrst strategy depends on developing a hy-
pothesis regarding the pathogenesis of ASDs, focusing ona potential candidate gene and testing it genetically foran association with ASDs. Candidate genes in ASDs in-clude, among others, those that seem to play a role inbrain development (eg, cerebellar Purkinje cell prolifer-ation) or neurotransmitter function (eg, serotonin).
80
The second strategy uses an indirect method and does

on 08 May 2023not require investigators to make assumptions regarding
the mechanism of inheritance. Instead, families withmultiple members who demonstrate an ASD (multiplexfamilies) are studied to identify recurring DNA markers(break points, translocations, duplications, and dele-tions) present in affected members but not in unaffectedmembers. Unfortunately, progress in determining a ge-netic etiology using this method has been impaired,because the phenotypic end points of ASDs are not welldeﬁned. Changing DSM criteria and inconsistent ascer-tainment strategies, which results in a hazy delineationbetween affected versus unaffected family members, ob-scure outcomes and challenge interpretation of results.
67
This phenotypic heterogeneity has challenged molecularsearches for the ASD gene(s) despite several genome-wide screens of the International Molecular GeneticStudy of Autism Consortium and multicenter collabora-tive efforts over the past couple of decades.
78,81–84 Al-
though at least 1 autism-linked abnormality has beenfound on almost every chromosome, sites on a fewchromosomes (X, 2, 3, 7, 15, 17, and 22) seem to bemore promising than others.
67,68,75,79,85–90 Maternally de-
rived 15q duplications are common; depending on theinvestigator, yields vary from 1% to 10%,
91with most in
the range of 1% to 3%.92,93Patients with these duplica-
tions may not display dysmorphic features, but theyoften have hypotonia and/or global developmental delay(GDD) and may develop seizures later. The abnormalitycan often be identiﬁed on high-resolution karyotypeanalysis. Other less common abnormalities have alsobeen reported.
94
Finally, the male predominance noted above also sug-
gests a genetic role in the inheritance of autism. Severalgenetic processes can lead to male predominance, in-cluding causative genes located on the X chromosome(X-linked disorders) and imprinted genes, but the reasonfor male predominance in autism is not completely un-derstood.
95
In a discussion of etiology, subtyping ASDs as either
idiopathic or secondary is helpful.67,79,95 For the purposes
of this discussion, the term “idiopathic” ASDs refers tocases in which children meet criteria for ASDs but do nothave a comorbid associated medical condition known tocause ASDs. Most individuals with an ASD have theidiopathic type. Children with idiopathic ASDs demon-strate variable behavioral phenotypes, are somewhat lesslikely to have comorbid GDD/MR, and generally do nothave dysmorphic features that herald a recognizablesyndrome. Nevertheless, twin and family studies haverevealed that idiopathic ASDs are heritable and have arecurrence rate of 5% to 6%.
67,94,95 The term “secondary”
ASDs refers to cases with an identiﬁable syndrome ormedical disorder known to be associated with ASDs.Whereas earlier reviews reported that the proportion ofindividuals with ASDs who have a comorbid syndromeor medical condition was 10% to 20%,
2,96–98 the propor-tion has decreased to less than 10% when using more
recent data sets.79,89,95,99–101 In a meta-analysis of 23 epi-
demiologic studies, Chakrabarti and Fombonne20,21 re-
vealed that a recognizable condition was identiﬁed inonly 6% of those with a conﬁrmed ASD. The rate of
coexisting MR (cognitive impairment associated with anIQ of /H1102170) in children with ASDs seemed to decrease
from 90% before the 1990s to less than 50% after2000,
28,29,34,35,102,103 possibly because of improved methods
in testing intelligence in this population and to the in-creased awareness of children with ASD with milderfeatures and higher functioning. This trend is important,because coexisting severe MR, especially in the presenceof dysmorphic features, increases the likelihood of iden-tifying a known disorder.
89,104–108 Neurogenetic syn-
dromes that seem to play a causative role or otherwiseare associated with ASDs include, but are not limited to:
●Fragile X syndrome109,110 : Fragile X syndrome is the
most common known genetic cause of AD and of MRin males. The phenotype includes MR, macrocephaly,large pinnae, large testicles (particularly after pu-berty), hypotonia, and joint hyperextensibility. Iden-tifying a patient with fragile X syndrome is importantfor genetic counseling purposes, because the diagnosishas implications for other family members. Dependingon the prevalence of comorbid MR in study subjectswith ASD, the etiologic yield of fragile X syndrome–DNA testing has ranged from 0% to 8%, with a me-dian of approximately 3% to 4%.
99,109,111 On the other
hand, as many as 30% to 50% of individuals withgenetically conﬁrmed fragile X syndrome will demon-strate some characteristics of ASDs.
102,110
●Neurocutaneous disorders: Tuberous sclerosis112–116 is
characterized by hypopigmented macules (sometimesrequiring a Wood’s lamp examination for visualizationin young children), ﬁbroangiomata, kidney lesions,central nervous system hamartomas, seizures, MR,and autistic and/or attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity dis-order (ADHD)–like behaviors. Although tuberoussclerosis is a dominant disorder (with genes located at9q and 16p), most cases represent new mutations.Although it is the most common neurocutaneous dis-order, neuroﬁbromatosis is less likely to be associatedwith ASDs. It also is autosomal-dominant, with half ofcases representing new mutations of the neuroﬁbro-matosis 1 gene on 17q.
117It is characterized by cafe ´a u
lait macules and freckling in the axillary and inguinalregions, neuroﬁbromas, and ocular Lisch nodules. Al-though most patients have a benign course and nor-mal intelligence, a small subset of individuals have MRand behavioral features that are consistent with ASDs.
●Phenylketonuria118: phenylketonuria now is a rare
cause of ASDs and MR in the United States, because it

on 08 May 2023is preventable as a result of newborn screening and
dietary intervention.
●Fetal alcohol syndrome119: Children who are exposed
to alcohol during gestation have an increased risk ofASDs in addition to other neurodevelopmental disor-ders.
●Angelman syndrome93,94,120–123 : Angelman syndrome is
associated with loss of the maternally expressed ubiq-uitin-protein ligase gene ( UBE3A ) on 15q through
deletion, paternal uniparental disomy, or imprintingerrors. Children with Angelman syndrome presentwith GDD (and often are nonverbal), hypotonia inearly childhood, wide-based ataxic gait, seizures, andprogressive spasticity. Angelman syndrome associatedwith a deletion of 15q can be detected with ﬂuores-cence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing; however,when it results from uniparental disomy, methylationstudies are necessary.
●Rett syndrome124–127 : Rett syndrome usually presents
with a classic phenotype and should be considered inall females who demonstrate autistic-like regression,especially if they have microcephaly, seizures, andhand-wringing stereotypies. Retrospective videoshave revealed early subtle motor symptoms during theﬁrst year of life.
128Now that it is possible to conﬁrm
this diagnosis with DNA testing (methyl CpG-bindingprotein 2 [ MECP2 ]) in approximately 80% of cases, it
has become apparent that there is a spectrum of se-verity, and some patients may present with atypicalfeatures including those consistent with ASDs. Rettsyndrome is much less common in males, and thepresentation is more varied. Some males die in infancyas a result of neonatal encephalopathy; others withcomorbid Klinefelter syndrome (as well as a few males[in isolated case reports] with a normal number of sexchromosomes) demonstrate more classic symp-toms.
129,130
●Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome131: Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome is a rare (1 in 20 000) autosomal-recessivedisorder caused by a metabolic error in cholesterolbiosynthesis. Although most patients present withmultiple congenital anomalies, failure to thrive, andMR, some may present with subtle physical featuressuch as webbing (syndactyly) of the second and thirdtoes, mild hypotonia, and autistic features. Recurrencerisk is 25%; thus, appropriate genetic counseling isimportant.
Whether the aforementioned conditions play a direct
or indirect etiologic role or simply are associated withASDs, they still represent a small minority of patientswith ASDs. Conversely, a few children with genetic syn-dromes that are characterized by features quite differentfrom ASDs also may meet DSM-IV-TR criteria. For ex-ample, recent studies have reported that 6% to 7% ofchildren with Down syndrome (typically characterized
by relatively good social skills compared with those inother domains)
59and almost 50% of children with
CHARGE syndrome (associated with mutations of theCHD7 gene
132) meet criteria for one of the ASDs.60There
have also been a few isolated reports of a mitochondrialand/or metabolic abnormality (eg, carnitine deﬁciency)being associated with an ASD, but the signiﬁcance ofthese reports is not clear.
133
Increased and decreased levels of T lymphocytes, im-
munoglobulins, and antibrain autoantibodies in the sys-temic circulation have been reported.
134These have been
observed chieﬂy in retrospective case studies of patientswith idiopathic ASDs, but systematic prospective studieshave conﬁrmed neither their existence nor their rele-vance.
87Prospective studies have revealed that, except
for a few individuals with recurrent infections, healthychildren with ASDs generally have normal immunefunction.
135Some studies have reported increased rates
of autoimmune disorders in families of children withASDs,
136particularly in the mothers (eg, thyroid disor-
ders137and psoriasis138); however, the relevance of these
common disorders to ASDs in children is unknown.Furthermore, studies have shown no increase in auto-immune disorders of the central nervous system, andpatients with ASDs did not themselves exhibit autoim-mune disorders.
139The contribution of possible immu-
nologic dysfunction remains to be further deﬁned.
Environmental Issues
Regardless of the mechanism, a review of studies pub-lished in the past 50 years revealed convincing evidencethat most cases of ASDs result from interacting geneticfactors.
67,95 However, the expression of the autism
gene(s) may be inﬂuenced by environmental fac-tors.
66,67,69,140 Although currently under investigation,
these factors may represent a “second-hit” phenomenonthat primarily occurs during fetal brain development.That is, environmental factors may modulate alreadyexisting genetic factors responsible for the manifestationof ASDs in individual children.
Prenatal Period
Because many of the developmental brain abnormalitiesknown to be associated with ASDs occur during the ﬁrstand second trimesters of pregnancy,
141,142 environmental
factors (eg, teratogens, such as thalidomide and valproicacid)
73are more likely to play a role in the fetus via
maternal factors. It is possible that maternal illness (eg,rubella) during pregnancy plays a role.
143,144 Recently,
the possible association between fetal testosterone con-centration and certain autistic behaviors such as abnor-mal social relationships and restricted interests at 4 yearsof age was investigated.

on 08 May 2023Perinatal Period
The effects of birth weight, duration of gestation, andevents around the time of birth have been investigatedalso, but ﬁndings have not been consistent.
72,146–152 A
signiﬁcant association between term newborn encepha-lopathy and children later diagnosed with ASD was re-ported recently.
72,150 Badawi et al150reported that 5% of
survivors of newborn encephalopathy were diagnosedwith an ASD, which represented an almost sixfold in-crease compared with matched controls. This increasemay represent a genetically derived predisposition(which makes the infants vulnerable to both encepha-lopathy and ASD) or an independent mechanism.
Postnatal Period
Etiologic possibilities occurring after birth have beenproposed—in particular, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)vaccine
153 and mercury-containing vaccines.154–156
In 2001, the Institute of Medicine157reviewed epidemi-
ologic population-based studies and concluded thatthere was no evidence of a causal association betweenthe MMR vaccine and autism. Studies that examined theassociation between MMR vaccine and autism since thepublication of that review have supported this conclu-sion.
27,95,103,158–161 Questions also have been raised about
the effects of environmental mercury exposure (includ-ing mercury-containing vaccines) on brain developmentin ASDs and other developmental disabilities.
154–156 Mer-
cury, in its organic form, is a known neurotoxin withneurologic sequelae, including motor impairment andvisual and intellectual deﬁcits, depending on the age atexposure and the type of mercury. There is no evidenceto date that children with neurodevelopmental disabili-ties, including autism, in the United States have in-creased mercury concentrations or environmental expo-sures.
162Using large data sets from the United States,
Sweden, and Denmark, to date, no consistent associa-tion has been found between thimerosal-containing vac-cines and neurodevelopmental outcomes or prevalenceof ASDs.
27,95,162–164 Despite evidence to the contrary, a
recent survey of parents of children with ASDs revealedthat 54% believed that their child’s ASD was caused byimmunizations; 53% thought it was caused by genet-ics.
165
Although the previous discussion reveals the wide
variety of conditions known to be associated with ASDs,currently, an etiologic investigation of the individualchild with an ASD infrequently identiﬁes a known causein the absence of GDD/MR, dysmorphic features, a pos-itive family history, and/or a focal neurologic examina-tion.
2,20,21,89,101,106–108
NEUROPATHOLOGY AND NEUROIMAGINGIn recent years, intense research efforts have focused onelucidating the neurobiological basis of ASDs. A growingbody of evidence from neuropathology and neuroimag-ing studies indicates that there are fundamental differ-
ences in brain growth and organization in people withASDs that have their origin in the prenatal period butextend through early childhood and into adulthood.
Neuropathologic studies of brain tissue from people
with autism have revealed several abnormalities
166–171
including:
●reduced numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum;
●abnormal maturation of the forebrain limbic system,
including reduced neuronal size, increased cell-pack-ing density, and decreased complexity of the neuropil(ie, the complex net of axonal, dendritic, and glialbranching in which the nerve cell is embedded);
●abnormalities in frontal and temporal lobe cortical
minicolumns, which are more numerous, smaller, andless compact in their cellular conﬁguration and dem-onstrate reduced neuropil space in the periphery
167;
●developmental changes in cell size and number in the
nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, deep cerebellarnuclei, and inferior olive; and
●brainstem abnormalities and neocortical malforma-
tions (eg, heterotopias).171
The most consistent neuropathologic ﬁndings suggest
pathology that arises in utero. The association of in-creased risk of ASDs associated with prenatal exposureto teratogens, such as thalidomide and valproic acid,suggests that early insults during critical periods of braindevelopment (as early as 20–24 days after conception inthe case of thalidomide) may be sufﬁcient to causeASDs.
171However, all of these neuropathologic ﬁndings
are based on detailed study of a relatively small numberof brains, and further investigation is required. Limitedavailability of brain tissue from people with well-char-acterized ASDs and age-matched controls has impededneuropathologic investigations. Efforts to remedy thisare underway with the establishment of the AutismTissue Project (1-800-272-4622 [for physicians] or1-877-333-0999 [for families]; www.memoriesofhope.org).
168
Kanner, in his initial clinical description of autism,
noted large head size in several of his patients.15In-
creased head circumference has since been shown to bea common physical ﬁnding in children with ASDs, and20% to 30% have macrocephaly, deﬁned as a headcircumference that measures more than 2 SDs above themean.
172,173 MRI studies have supported the ﬁnding of
increased brain volume in children with ASDs, with90% of toddlers with ASDs having larger-than-normalbrain volumes in 1 study.
174,175 Postmortem brain

on 08 May 2023life, leading to above-average head circumference or
overt macrocephaly.176,177 Fewer adults with ASDs have
been found to exhibit increased brain size comparedwith controls, indicating that there may be decelerationof brain growth at some point beyond early child-hood.
176,178,179 It is interesting to note that increased blood
concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor andseveral other neurotrophins have been detected in new-born infants who are later diagnosed with ASDs.
180This
ﬁnding, if replicated, may have implications regardingthe mechanism of early brain overgrowth. Age-relateddifferences in serotonin synthesis capacity also havebeen demonstrated between children with ASDs andchildren in control groups,
181which leads to speculation
regarding the neurotrophic role of serotonin in abnor-mal brain growth and organization in children withASDs.
In addition to whole-brain volume differences, spe-
ciﬁc regional gray- and white-matter volumetric differ-ences have been described. The frontal, limbic, basalganglia, and cerebellar regions have been implicatedmost consistently.
172,182–184 Abnormalities in sulcal and
gyral anatomy have been found by using surface-map-ping techniques.
185,186 The regional gray- and white-mat-
ter volume differences also seem to be age related, al-though larger cross-sectional studies and longitudinalstudies are needed to clarify the meaning of these ﬁnd-ings.
A variety of functional MRI studies during cognitive
tasks or in response to visual or auditory stimuli suggestthat individuals with ASDs use different cognitive strat-egies and, in some cases, different brain areas to processcertain types of information.
182,187 For example, func-
tional neuroimaging techniques have indicated the pres-ence of abnormalities in face recognition and executivefunctioning in adults with high-functioning ASDs.
188Hy-
poactivation of the fusiform gyrus in face-recognitiontasks has been one of the most consistent ﬁndings
187and,
in concert with abnormalities in amygdala activation,may relate to the abnormalities in gaze ﬁxation that areseen in people with ASDs.
189Functional MRI evidence
has also been used to postulate impaired “connectivity”between various cortical regions in the brains of peoplewith ASDs.
190–192 Most recently, some investigators have
attempted to explain deﬁcits in empathy, imitation, andlanguage as abnormalities in the functioning of mirrorneuron systems.
193These systems are a newly discovered
subset of cells found in several areas of the brain thatseem to ﬁre when an individual simply observes anoth-er’s actions—that is, it seems they directly reﬂect actionsperformed by another in the observer’s brain. They alsomay play a role in the ability to recognize and empathizewith or “mirror” the feelings of others. These functionalbrain differences provide intriguing links between theneuroanatomical substrate and the characteristic clinicalfeatures of people with ASDs.Although neuroimaging research has identiﬁed volu-
metric and other abnormalities in groups of patients withASDs compared with controls, a reliable marker has notbeen identiﬁed, and routine clinical neuroimaging forindividuals with ASDs is not recommended.
106,107,183,194
CLINICAL SIGNSWhereas severe social skills deﬁcits and restricted, repet-itive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, andactivities are core features of all ASDs, signiﬁcant lan-guage delays are characteristic of only AD and PDD-NOS.
3,4One of the most challenging aspects in recogniz-
ing ASDs is the wide heterogeneity of features inindividual children. There is no pathognomonic feature;however, a few of the early social deﬁcits (eg, delayed orabsent joint attention [JA]) seem to be fairly reliable redﬂags for ASDs. The autism spectrum encompasses anextremely heterogeneous phenotype with indistinct endpoints, especially at the mild end of the spectrum. Theseverity of each of the core deﬁcits varies signiﬁcantlyamong children with ASDs.
Although the social deﬁcits occur earlier and may be
more speciﬁc, they can be subtle and less often recog-nized or articulated by parents. Speech delays usuallyprompt parents to raise concerns to their child’s PCP.Most parents become concerned between 15 and 18months of age but may delay discussing their concernswith their child’s physician for several months.
35,195–198
Recently, the media and public agencies have raisedpublic awareness about the importance of recognizingthe early signs, including those present during the ﬁrstyears of life. This being the case, it is anticipated thatparents may begin to voice concerns to their infant’spediatrician earlier and that these concerns may nowtarget the often earlier-appearing social deﬁcits. Presen-tations can differ widely from one child to the next;some are perceived by parents as “different” during theﬁrst few months of life, others present with delayedspeech development during the second year of life, andstill others may appear to be normal only to regress andlose skills after the ﬁrst year of life.
199,200 AS in children
may go unnoticed until they are of school age, whenteachers notice difﬁculties with peer interactions. Ex-panded reviews regarding early signs are available.
201–203
Social Skills DeﬁcitsAlthough more speciﬁc than language deﬁcits, socialdeﬁcits appearing in the ﬁrst 2 years of life often haveescaped parent recognition.
204–206 Children with ASDs
universally demonstrate deﬁcits in social relatedness de-ﬁned as the inherent drive to connect with others andshare complementary feeling states.
207Children with
ASDs often do not appear to seek connectedness; theyare content being alone, ignore their parents’ bids forattention, and seldom make eye contact or bid for oth-ers’ attention with gestures or vocalizations. In later

on 08 May 2023years, they have difﬁculty sharing the emotional state of
others in cooperative games and group settings and mayhave few, if any, friends.
Deﬁcits in JA seem to be one of the most distinguish-
ing characteristics of very young children withASDs.
198,208–216 JA is a normal, spontaneously occurring
behavior whereby the infant shows enjoyment in shar-ing an object (or event) with another person by lookingback and forth between the two. Later, gestures and/orspeech also can be used to engage another’s attentionwith regard to the objects and events simply for theenjoyment of sharing the experiences. Just like otherdevelopmental skills, development of JA skills is step-wise; it occurs in stages beginning in the ﬁrst few monthsof life. Similar to language skills, receptive JA skills usu-ally are mastered before expressive ones. JA begins withjoyous smiling in recognition of and response to a parentor familiar caregiver’s smiles and vocalizations. At ap-proximately 8 months of age, an infant will follow theparent’s gaze and look in the same direction when aparent looks away (ie, to check the time). Children beginto “follow a point” at approximately 10 to 12 months ofage. If a parent points in the direction of an interestingobject or event and says, “Look!” the typically develop-ing child will look in the intended direction and then,after seeing the object/event, look back at the parent inacknowledgment and shared expression. Infants withASD may not follow a point, even when one tries re-peatedly in a loud voice calling their name or uses phys-ical prompts, such as touching the child’s shoulder be-fore pointing.
204They may look in the indicated direction
eventually, but this is not followed by shared lookingand expression.
At approximately 12 to 14 months of age, the typi-
cally developing child will begin himself to initiate apoint, at ﬁrst to request a desired object that is out ofreach and, a couple of months later, to draw the parent’sattention to share an interesting object, person, or event.Depending on his speech skills, he may utter simplesounds (“uh”) or actual words while pointing. Pointingto request an object is called “protoimperative pointing.”Deﬁcits vary, as some children with ASDs may makerudimentary pointing efforts by opening and closingtheir hand while it is raised in the direction of the desireditem but without any back-and-forth looking between itand the caregiver. Another frequent strategy is to takethe parent’s hand to lead him or her to the object. At 14to 16 months of age, the typically developing child willbegin to point simply to “comment” about or “share” aninteresting object/event (which is called “protodeclara-tive pointing”). As he points, he will look alternativelybetween the object/event of interest and the parent. It isthe shared social experience, not the tangible object/event, that the child seeks. Children with ASDs consis-tently fail to point to “comment” at age-appropriatetimes, and when they do, they are less likely to showpositive affect and connectedness during the act. Some
high-functioning children with ASDs may point to labelobjects, shapes, and colors that they have learned in arote fashion, but this often is done without any intent ofcommunicating in a social context and is not consideredJA. Mastery of JA seems to be necessary for functionallanguage development; in fact, mastery of protodeclara-tive pointing seems to be a reliable predictor of func-tional language development within 1 year.
7,217–219 JA
skills progress to involve ongoing back-and-forth bids forattention and social interactions with multiple emo-tional expressions, sounds, words, and other gestures.
Orienting to social stimuli—in particular, turning
consistently to respond to one’s own name—is an earlyskill (8–10 months of age) that often is deﬁcient inchildren with ASDs.
215,220 However, it is not speciﬁc to
children with ASDs, because children with hearing im-pairments also may fail to orient to their name. In fact,parents of children later diagnosed with ASDs often raisea concern about hearing. Hearing seems “selective” inthat children with ASDs may hear and attend well toenvironmental sounds but not to human voices.
221Social
referencing222is the ability to recognize the emotional
states of others as they respond to various stimuli. Whenfaced with a novel situation, a typically developing in-fant might look to his mother for an indication of de-light, anger, or fear in her facial expression. His facialexpression then usually will mimic hers, although hemay not fully understand the situation. A child with anASD engages in less imitation.
223
Because children with ASDs lack fundamental social
skill building blocks, they may be less likely to developappropriate peer relationships according to age and lan-guage ability. They may have few or no friends, and whenthey do, the relationships may evolve around the child’sown special interests. Another factor that impedes lastingfriendships is impaired central coherence or the inability tointerpret stimuli in a global way.
224,225 Instead, they focus
on the parts, make less use of context, and miss the “bigpicture,” which makes social interactions challenging. Theyalso have difﬁculties understanding the perspective of oth-ers or lack “theory-of-mind” (ToM) skills. ToM is theawareness that others have thoughts and emotions that areindependent from one’s own; it is the ability that allowsone to infer states of mind on the basis of external behav-ior.
226,227 Typically developing children begin to have some
sense of mental states of others by 4 years of age.197,228,229
Because of ToM impairments, children with ASDs havedifﬁculties with empathy, sharing, and comforting. Baron-Cohen
230coined the term “mindblindedness” when refer-
ring to persons with ASDs who demonstrate severe ToMdeﬁcits.
Communication Deﬁcits

on 08 May 2023though this may change as parents are becoming more
aware of social milestones. As noted previously, mostparents sense something is wrong by the time the childis 18 months old.
195–198 Lack of speech has been consid-
ered a hallmark of AD, especially when it is associatedwith the lack of desire to communicate and lack ofnonverbal compensatory efforts such as gestures. How-ever, children with milder symptoms, especially thosewith normal cognitive skills, may have some speech.Their speech may not be functional or ﬂuent and maylack communicative intent. It can be scripted (from fa-vorite videos or television programs) and stereotypic.Echolalia, sometimes called “parroting,” is the repetitionof another person’s speech. Echolalia is classiﬁed as “im-mediate” when the child repeats vocalizations promptlyafter hearing them or “delayed” when there is a timelapse (hours, days, weeks). Typically developing childrenpass through a “vocabulary-burst stage,” when brief pe-riods of immediate echolalia are not unusual.
197On the
other hand, echolalia in children with ASDs may persistthroughout the life span and consist of a mixture ofimmediate and delayed varieties. Utterances of childrenwith ASDs may be more clearly articulated, have a moremonotone quality, and/or consist of larger verbal“chunks” (ie, entire television advertisement jingles,video reenactments, or recitations of nursery rhymes)than those of typically developing children. Sometimes,echolalia may even give the impression of “advanced”speech because of sophisticated vocabulary, grammar,and syntax. The clinician should be careful to differen-tiate between typical and autistic echolalia; usually, aformal evaluation by a speech-language pathologist(SLP) is needed. Such an assessment also may reveal adissociation between these “advanced” expressive skillsand delayed receptive ones in that the child may beunable to follow simple 1-step commands, which is a 12-to 14-month-old skill. Some parents will note that theirchild seems overly “independent” because, rather thanask for desired objects, he uses advanced motor skills toobtain them himself (ie, moving a stool to a counter topto obtain an object at an age younger than typicallyexpected). Some children with ASDs become quiteskilled at rotely labeling colors, shapes, numbers, andletters of the alphabet, yet they are unable to point tothem when asked to do so by another or incorporate thelabels into functional language. A few may later develophyperlexia or advanced verbal reading without corre-sponding comprehension skills.
Some children with ASDs say “pop-up words” with-
out any apparent stimulus or communicative intent.They are spontaneous and inconsistent, although some-times they may occur during acutely stressful situations.These words are said out of context for a short period oftime (days or weeks) and then, as suddenly as theymight pop up for no apparent reason, they disap-pear.
197,119 Children with ASDs also may develop “lan-guage” in overlearned or gestalt phrases that are ac-
quired and spoken almost as a single “giant-word” (ie,Whatisit? Idontknow). At the same time, they are un-able to combine words in novel or original phrases orsentences that convey true meaning.
Although lack of speech, scripted speech, parroting
without communicative intent, and pop-up and giantwords are common classic presentations, earlier pre-speech deﬁcits often exist that, if detected, could facili-tate earlier diagnosis.* These deﬁcits include:
●lack of appropriate gaze;
●lack of warm, joyful expressions with gaze;
●lack of the alternating to-and-fro pattern of vocaliza-
tions between infant and parent that usually occurs atapproximately 6 months of age (ie, infants with ASDsusually continue vocalizing without regard for theparent’s speech);
●lack of recognition of mother’s (or father’s or consis-
tent caregiver’s) voice;
●disregard for vocalizations (ie, lack of response to
name), yet keen awareness for environmental sounds;
●delayed onset of babbling past 9 months of age;
●decreased or absent use of prespeech gestures (wav-
ing, pointing, showing);
●lack of expressions such as “oh oh” or “huh”;
●lack of interest or response of any kind to neutral
statements (eg, “Oh no, it’s raining again!”)
The AAP brochure “ Is Your One-Year-Old Communicat-
ing With You? ”13was developed to help raise parent and
physician awareness of these earlier social communica-tion milestones and to promote recognition of symptomsof ASDs before 18 months of age.
Regression
Approximately 25% to 30% of children with ASDs beginto say words but then stop speaking, often between theages of 15 and 24 months.
199,200,208 Regression of skills in
children with ASDs may also include loss of gesturalcommunication (wave, point, etc) and social skills (eg,eye contact and response to praise) or a combination ofboth. Regression can be gradual or sudden, and it may besuperimposed on subtle preexisting developmental de-lays or atypical development, such as an unusually in-tense interest in objects or other nonsocial stimuli duringthe ﬁrst year of life.
205Although it may be tempting to
attribute regression to environmental stressors (eg, birthof a new sibling or a move to a new house), this resultsin a delay in diagnosis. Regression is a well-documentedhallmark of ASDs and should always alert the PCP toconsider ASDs.

on 08 May 2023Asperger Syndrome
Children with AS may have mild or limited speech de-lays (see the DSM-IV-TR
4criteria in Table 2) and escape
recognition until preschool or early school age, whentheir inability to make friends becomes a concern. Al-though often unnoticed, language development usuallyis atypical. Children with AS often are quite verbal abouta certain topic of interest, but they are unable to expresssimple feelings or recognize the feelings and viewpointsof others. Speech may be ﬂuent but limited to only a fewtopics, typically those that hold a strong, all-consuminginterest for the child. Speech also can be overly formal(pedantic), which is a reason why children with ASsometimes are described as “little professors.”
227Children
with AS also have deﬁcits in the social use of language(pragmatics): how to choose a topic of conversation;understanding and producing appropriate tempo, facialexpression, and body language during conversation;turn taking; recognizing when the partner has lost in-terest in a topic; knowing when to start, sustain, and enda conversation on the basis of listener cues; knowingwhen and how to repair a communication breakdown;and using the appropriate degree of formality and po-liteness.
197,227 Children with AS especially have difﬁculty
sustaining a conversation on a topic that is initiated byanother. Language may seem odd, self-centered, and notlistener responsive and results in a monotone mono-logue. They may demonstrate unique delivery of speech(prosody) in regard to intonation, volume, rhythm,pitch, and personal space that also tends to disregardlistener needs. Children with AS may have difﬁcultywith abstract reasoning and discussion of thoughts andopinions of others. Inability to discern and judge theconversational intents of others, especially when theirconversation includes words or phrases with ambiguousmeanings, impairs their ability to understand metaphors,humor, teasing idioms, irony, lies, jokes, and fauxpas.
226,227,229 Older children with high-functioning AD or
PDD-NOS and ﬂuent speech also may demonstrate someof the above-mentioned language characteristics.
Play Skills
Lack of, or signiﬁcantly delayed, pretend play skills cou-pled with persistent sensory-motor and/or ritualisticplay are characteristic of ASDs. Some children with se-vere ASDs may never progress past the sensory-motorplay stage. They mouth, twirl, bang, and manipulateobjects in a stereotypic or ritualistic manner. The play ofchildren with ASDs often is repetitive and lacks creativ-ity and imitation.
3,4Typical examples include spinning
the wheels or lining up cars instead of “driving” them,arranging crayons instead of coloring with them, orstacking blocks in the same sequence time after time.Often they prefer to play with common objects (string,sticks, rocks, or ballpoint pens) rather than store-boughttoys with the exception of trains or characters fromfavorite videos and television shows. Puzzles, especially
shape-matching ones and computerized “puzzle games,”also are quite popular.
222Children with ASDs often are
content to play alone for hours, requiring little attentionor supervision. Often this “play” is either constructive(puzzles, computer games, and blocks), ritualistic (liningobjects up or sorting/matching shapes or colors) or sen-sory-motor (mouthing, banging, twirling) in nature.Children with ASDs may seem to enjoy chase games androughhousing, but it is often the sensory-motor aspectsof these activities, rather than their social aspects, thatare enjoyable. They have trouble interacting in groupsand cooperating in the social rules of more sophisticatedgames. Often they are left out, ignored, and at high riskof being victimized and bullied by peers.
231
Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Patterns of Behavior,Interests, and ActivitiesChildren with ASDs can demonstrate atypical behaviorsin a variety of areas including peculiar mannerisms,unusual attachments to objects, obsessions, compul-sions, self-injurious behaviors, and stereotypies. Stereo-typies are repetitive, nonfunctional, atypical behaviorssuch as hand ﬂapping, ﬁnger movements, rocking, ortwirling.
3,4,203 Although most stereotypies are harmless,
they are problematic in that they may prevent the childfrom accomplishing a task or learning new skills. Al-though stereotypies are distinctive and obvious, they arenot speciﬁc to children with ASDs, because many chil-dren with profound MR and/or severe sensory deﬁcitsalso demonstrate stereotypies. Even typically developingtoddlers, especially before the onset of ﬂuent language,may ﬂap their arms brieﬂy when they are excited orfrustrated. Stereotypies associated with ASDs often donot appear until after 3 years of age
232and commonly
manifest as ﬁnger ﬂicking, unusual eye gazing, habitualtoe walking, and/or persistent snifﬁng and licking ofnonfood items.
Although most children, at some time during their
early development, form attachments with a stuffed an-imal, special pillow, or blanket, children with ASDs mayprefer hard items (ballpoint pens, ﬂashlight, keys, actionﬁgures, etc). Moreover, the attachment is more persis-tent, in that they may insist on holding the object at alltimes, although these are rarely, if at all, used in real“play.” Whereas younger children with ASDs may haverestricted interests in regards to objects, the restrictedinterests in those with AS more often relate to topics andfacts.
227For example, rather than carrying a toy train at
all times, there is an obsession with train schedules.Sometimes the item/topic of interest may be typical forany child, but it is the degree of interest that is abnormal.For example, similar to typically developing children, achild with an ASD may be fascinated with dinosaurs, buthe knows far more details about them and persists inplaying or discussing them to the exclusion of all else.

on 08 May 2023Perseveration, or continuation of speech or play to an
exceptional degree or beyond a desired point, is commonin children with ASDs. Children with ASDs may protestvigorously when forced to transition from an activity ortopic of interest or when a usual routine is changed.Without warning, these protests may quickly escalate tosevere and prolonged temper tantrums characterized byaggression or self-injurious behaviors.
Self-injurious behaviors (head banging, skin picking,
eye poking, hand biting) are stereotypies that may causebodily harm and are more common in children withsevere GDD/MR (intellectual disabilities) or ASDs withcomorbid GDD/MR.
233Self-injurious behaviors may be
precipitated by frustration during unsuccessful commu-nication attempts, transitions, anxiety in new environ-ments, boredom, depression, fatigue, sleep deprivation,or pain. The presence of self-injurious behaviors, aggres-sion, and other extreme behaviors may prevent the childfrom participating in integrated activities in the commu-nity with typically developing peers and cause signiﬁcantfamily stress.
Additional Coexisting Conditions That Are Not Core Features
in the DSM-IV-TR
Cognitive Abnormalities (GDD/MR or Intellectual Disability,
Learning Differences, and Splinter/Savant Skills)The prevalence of comorbid GDD/MR or intellectualdisability (the appropriate term depends on age andavailability of both a standardized IQ score and a formalassessment of adaptive skills) with ASDs was estimatedto be approximately 90% before 1990.
62On the basis of
later studies published in the 1990s, consensus guide-lines reported the prevalence as approximately 70% to75%.
1,2,106,107,234 Prevalence studies published in the new
millennium have reported rates of ASDs with comorbidGDD/MR of just under 50%,
28,29,34,103 whereas 2 English
studies reported rates as low as 26% to 29%.20,21Better
ascertainment of children without cognitive deﬁcits (inparticular AS, which by deﬁnition is characterized bynormal intelligence), improved professional training,and more effective strategies/tools for evaluating cogni-tive abilities in children with ASDs all may contribute tothe decreasing prevalence of comorbid GDD/MR.
One unique characteristic of ASDs is the “uneven-
ness” of skills. Abilities may be signiﬁcantly delayed insome areas of development yet “advanced” in others,often because of exceptional focusing, memory, calcula-tion, music, or art abilities.
235They may be labeled as
“splinter skills” when they serve no purpose in day-to-day life and do not improve functional outcomes. Rarely,highly developed talents or savant skills may promote avocation that provides ﬁnancial independence and, oc-casionally, national recognition.
236–238Sensory-Motor Symptoms
Although sensory symptoms (eg, hyperacusis) are morefrequent and prominent in children with ASDs, there isno evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate chil-dren with ASDs from children with other developmentaldisabilities.
239Children with ASDs may demonstrate si-
multaneous hyposensitivities and hypersensitivities forstimuli within the same sensory modality.
240For exam-
ple, they may seem overly sensitive to certain environ-mental noises but lack response to human voice, or theymay visually inspect the details of an object but notnotice the comings and goings of other people in theroom. Others may have oral aversions and/or total-body“tactile defensiveness” to soft touch (fabric bumps onsocks and sweatshirts) or hugs yet be insensitive topain.
241Sensory factors related to food, such as texture,
color, and taste, may lead to highly restricted diets. Moreresearch is needed to operationalize the concept of sen-sory integration and possible interventions and deﬁne itsrole in ASDs.
In addition to unusual motor stereotypies that serve
as deﬁning characteristics of ASDs discussed previously,some children with ASDs also may demonstrate atypicalmotor development, poor coordination, or deﬁcits inpraxis (motor planning, execution, and sequencing).
240
Some investigators believe that, although not a deﬁningcharacteristic by DSM standards, motor clumsiness is adistinguishing characteristic of AS.
86,242 Finally, some
children may appear to be “hyperactive” and motordriven with an exterior focus of attention and actuallymeet criteria for comorbid ADHD (although currentDSM-IV-TR criteria exclude making the diagnosis ofADHD in the presence of an ASD).
8,240,243 Other children
may be hypoactive and withdrawn and have an interiorfocus of attention.
240
In summary, ASDs are characterized by a broad array
of clinical features; some are more speciﬁc to ASDs thanothers (JA deﬁcits versus stereotypies). Familiarity withthe early social and preverbal communication deﬁcitswill help the PCP recognize ASDs earlier, which should,in turn, facilitate the prompt initiation of appropriateinterventions.
SURVEILLANCE AND SCREENING
Because the prevalence of ASDs is approximately 6 to 7per 1000 in the United States,
28,29 PCPs are likely to
provide care for children with ASDs. Early identiﬁcationof ASDs is important, because it allows early interven-tion, etiologic investigation, and counseling regardingrecurrence risk. The medical home is an important set-ting for surveillance and screening to detect ASDs andother developmental disorders. In the past, it was notunusual for parents’ initial concerns to be dismissed andfor diagnosis and intervention to be delayed.

on 08 May 2023dren with ASDs was 48 months, and the mean age of the
ﬁrst ASD diagnosis was 61 months.35
The goal of this clinical report is to help pediatricians
identify children at an earlier age who are at risk of anASD. An ASD-speciﬁc surveillance and screening algo-rithm (Fig 1) has been developed to facilitate the iden-tiﬁcation process. It builds on the developmental surveil-lance and screening algorithm for pediatric preventivecare visits that was published in the 2006 policy state-ment “Identifying Infants and Young Children With De-velopmental Disorders in the Medical Home: An Algo-rithm for Developmental Surveillance and Screening.”
246
General Developmental Surveillance and ScreeningAccording to the AAP policy statement “Identifying In-fants and Young Children With Developmental Disor-ders in the Medical Home: An Algorithm for Develop-mental Surveillance and Screening,”
246“surveillance” is
the ongoing process of identifying children who may beat risk of developmental delays, and “screening” is theuse of standardized tools at speciﬁc intervals to supportand reﬁne the risk. As an analogy, whereas surveillancerepresents a “moving picture” of the child’s unfoldingdevelopment, screening represents “snapshots” of thechild’s development at speciﬁc times. Developmentalsurveillance should occur at every preventive visitthroughout childhood and includes the following com-ponents: eliciting and attending to the parents’ concerns;maintaining a developmental history; making accurateand informed observations of the child; identifying thepresence of risk and protective factors; and documentingthe process and ﬁndings.
246Research has revealed that
parents have valid concerns about their children’s devel-opment, although careful interpretation of the concernsis needed.
247,248 However, parental concerns may not be
shared if the PCP does not ask about the child’s devel-opment, and lack of parental concern about develop-ment does not imply typical development.
247–250 There-
fore, a systematic surveillance strategy must be used forall children.
246Screening with a standardized develop-
mental tool should be performed whenever concerns areraised through the ongoing surveillance process. TheAAP also recommends that all children be screened witha standardized developmental tool at speciﬁc intervals(ie, at the 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month visits) regardlessof whether a concern has been raised or a risk has beenidentiﬁed during the surveillance process (see the AAPdevelopmental screening and surveillance algorithm
246).
Surveillance for ASD
Surveillance at the ﬁrst preventive care visit (Fig 1, Steps
1aand 2) should begin with a family history to deter-
mine if there are any family members, especially a sib-ling, who have been diagnosed with ASDs. Because therisk of having symptoms of ASDs in younger siblings ofchildren with ASDs is approximately 10 times higher,the pediatrician needs to be extra vigilant in monitoring
for early abnormal signs. Studies of infant siblings withASDs have revealed that very subtle early signs do existand can be perceived during the ﬁrst year of life.
204,205
Until recently, most knowledge regarding very earlysigns was obtained from retrospective systematic reviewsof home videos, particularly ﬁrst birthday party vid-eos.
251Studies of home videos at earlier ages have pro-
vided additional retrospective information that revealssubtle abnormalities in infants who were thought to betypically developing and later diagnosed as having re-gressive autism.
205Several groups of investigators are
following younger siblings of children diagnosed withASDs and providing prospective information as symp-toms emerge in these infants at high risk.
204Preliminary
results support the feasibility of recognizing subtle signsof ASDs in infants at high risk.
204,206,213,214,252,253 Some of
the very early signs reported by several investigatorsinclude extremes of temperament and behavior (rangingfrom marked irritability to alarming passivity); poor eyecontact; poor response to other’s voices, especially toone’s name being called
252; poor attempts at interactive
play; more interest in looking at objects than people;delayed pointing to request or share; decreased to-and-fro babbling and jargoning; and lack of warm, joyful,reciprocating expressions.
Surveillance should include asking parents open-
ended questions about their concerns regarding thechild’s development and behavior ( Step 2 ). Parental con-
cerns about inconsistent hearing or unusual responsive-ness also are important; for example, parents may noticethat the child responds consistently to a quiet sound,such as the crinkle of a plastic snack bag, but not to ahuman voice calling his name. In addition, parent con-cerns may be stimulated by comments made by othercare providers such as child care staff or preschool teach-ers. Recently, however, the public media have signiﬁ-cantly increased awareness of ASDs and sometimes hasstimulated unnecessary concerns. The AAP patient edu-cation brochure “ Is Your One -Year-Old Communicating
With You? ”
13can be distributed to all parents at their
child’s 9- or 12-month preventive visit to educate themabout early social communication milestones to helpthem identify valid areas of concern.
Surveillance also includes asking age-speciﬁc ques-
tions about whether certain developmental milestoneshave been attained. When this approach is used, it isimportant to include social and emotional milestones inaddition to the traditional motor, language, and prob-lem-solving milestones
254,255 (see www.ﬁrstsigns.org). To
recognize ASDs as early as possible, it is important to askabout the development of verbal and nonverbal com-munication, reciprocal social interaction (including eyecontact, JA and social referencing, and sharing of inter-ests or achievements), and representational or pretendplay skills.

3. Schedule Follow-up Visit
4. Re-enter Algorithm at 1bSurveillance and Screening Algorithm: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)  
1a - Developmental concerns, 
including those about social skill 
deficits, should be included as one 
of several health topics addressed at 
each pediatric preventive care visit 
through the first 5 year s of life.     
(Go to step 2)1b – At the parents’ request, or when a concern is 
identified in a previous visit, a child may be scheduled 
for a “problem-targeted” clinic visit because of concerns 
about ASD. Parent concerns may be based on 
observed behaviors, social or language deficits, issues 
raised by other caregivers, or heightened anxiety 
produced by ASD coverage in the media. (Go to step 2)
2 - Developmental surveillance is a flexible, longitudinal, continuous, and cumulative process whereby health care 
professionals identify children who may have developmental problems. There are 5 components of 
developmental surveillance: eliciting and attending to the parents’ concerns about their child’s development, 
documen ting and mainta ining a developm ental history, maki ng accurate  observations of  the child, identifying the 
risk and protective factors, and maintaining an accurate record and documenting the process and findings. The 
concerns of parents, other caregivers, and pediatricians all should be included in determining whether 
surveillance suggests that the child may be at risk of an ASD. In addition, younger siblings of children with an 
ASD should also be considered at risk, because they are 10 times more likely to develop symptoms of an ASD 
than children without a sibling with an ASD. Scoring risk factors will help determine the next steps. (Go to step 3)
For more information on developmental surveillance, see “Identifying Infants and Young Children With Developmental Disorders in  the Medical Home: An Algorithm for 
Developmental Surveillance and Screening” ( Pediatrics 2006;118:405-420). 
3 - Scoring risk factors: 
• If the child does not have a sibling with an ASD and there are no concerns 
from the parents, other caregivers, or pediatrician: Score=0 (Go to step 4) 
• If the child has only 1 risk factor, either a sibling with ASD or the concern of 
a parent, caregiver, or pediatrician: Score=1 (Go to step 3a) 
• If the child has 2 or more risk factors: Score=2+ (Go to step 8) 3a:
Is the Patient at
Least 18-Months
Old?3a –  
• If the child’s age is <18 
months, Go to step 5a 
• If the child’s age is ≥18 
months, Go to step 5b
4 – In the absence of established risk factors and parental/provider concerns (score=0), a level-1 ASD-specific tool should be 
administered at the 18- and 24-month visits. (Go to step 5c)  If this is not an 18- or 24-month visit, (Go to step 7b).
Note: In the AAP policy, “Identifying Infants and Young Children With Developmental Disorders in the Medical Home: An Algorithm  for Developmental 
Surveillance and Screening”, a general developmental screen is recommended at the 9-, 18-, and 24-or 30-month visits and an ASD  screening is 
recommended at the 18-month visit. This clinical report also recommends an ASD screening at the 24-month visit to identify chil dren who may regress after 
18 months of age.
5a - If the child’s age is <18 
months, the pediatrician should 
use a tool that specifically 
addresses the clinical 
characteristics of ASDs, such 
as those that target social-
communication skills.                
(Go to step 6a)5b - If the child’s 
age is ≥18 months, 
the pediatrician 
should use an 
ASD-specific 
screening tool.       
(Go to step 6a)5c – For all children 
ages 18 or 24 months (regardless of risk 
factors), the pediatrician 
should use an ASD-
specific screening tool.      
(Go to step 6b)
AAP-recommended strategies for using ASD screening tools: “Autism: Caring for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Resource Toolkit for Clinicians” (in press)*
6a – When the result of the screening is 
negative , Go to step 7a
When the result of the screening is 
positive ,  Go to step 86b – When the result of the ASD screening (at 18- 
and 24-month visits) is negative, Go to step 7b
When the result of the ASD screening (at 18- and 24- 
month visits) is positive , Go to step 8
7a – If the child demonstrates risk but has a negative screening re sult, 
information about ASDs should be provided to parents. The 
pediatrician should schedule an extra visit within 1 month to address 
any residual ASD concerns or additional developmental/ behavioral 
concerns after a negative screening result. The child will then re-enter 
the algorithm at 1b. A “wait-and-see” approach is discouraged. If the only risk factor is a sibling with 
an ASD, the pediatrician should maintain a higher index of suspicion and address ASD symptoms at 
each preventive care visit, but an early follow-up within 1 month is not necessary unless a parental 
concern subsequently arises.  7b – If this is not an 
18- or 24-month 
visit, or when the 
result of the ASD 
screening is 
negative , the pediatrician can inform the 
parents and schedule the next routine 
preventive visit. The child will then re-enter the 
algorithm at 1a.
8 – If the screening result is positive for possible ASD in step 6a or 6b, the pediatrician should provide peer reviewed 
and/or consensus-developed ASD materials . Because a positive screening result does not determine a diagnosis of 
ASD, the child should be referred for a comprehensive ASD evaluation, to early intervention/early childhood education 
services (depending on child’s age), and an audiologic evaluation. A categorical diagnosis is not needed to access 
intervention services. These programs often provide evaluations and other services even before a medical evaluation 
is complete. A referral to intervention services or school also is indicated when other developmental/behavioral 
concerns exist, even though the ASD screening result is negative. The child should be scheduled for a follow-up visit and will then re-enter the algorithm at 1b. All communication between the referral sources and the pediatrician should 
be coordinated.

on 08 May 2023Child Neurology Society practice parameter on screening
and diagnosis of autism107suggests that the following “red
ﬂags” are absolute indications for immediate evaluation:
●no babbling or pointing or other gesture by 12
months;
●no single words by 16 months;
●no 2-word spontaneous (not echolalic) phrases by 24
months; and
●loss of language or social skills at any age.
Pediatricians should become concerned ( Step 2 )i ft h e
answers to these questions reveal deﬁcits or delays inmilestones or if behaviors typical of ASD are observedduring an ofﬁce visit.
In older, more developmentally advanced children,
including many with AS, surveillance questions ( Step 2 )
may elicit concerns about social interaction difﬁcultiesrelated to more subtle communication problems, such aspragmatic language impairment and lack of understand-ing of nonliteral forms of communication (ﬁgures ofspeech, humor, sarcasm, metaphor, etc), difﬁculty tak-ing the perspective of another (resulting in inappropriateor offensive behavior, gullibility, and lack of commonsense), and obsession with facts, details, or collections.Pragmatic language refers to the use of language in socialinteraction and includes instinctive rules governing fac-tors, such as topic maintenance and turn taking in con-versation, how sentences are made to ﬁt in with the ﬂowof a conversation, how unspoken premises are inferred,how degrees of formality and politeness are signaled,and prosody (modulation of the intonation, rhythm,volume, timing, and stress of the voice). The parentsmay note that the child lacks true friendships and isviewed as odd, eccentric, or “weird” by his /H11032peers.
In addition, during the well-child visit, the PCP may
try to interact with the patient by using a few simplestrategies depending on the child’s age. For example, thePCP can note the response when calling the child’s nameat the 12-month well-child visit, and/or the JA mile-stone of “following a point” can be elicited at the 12-,18-, and 24-month well-child visits as part of routinedevelopmental surveillance. In the latter, the pediatri-cian points to an object at a distance, such as a picture onthe wall or a mobile, while making a verbal request forthe child to look. Whereas a typically developing childwould look in the direction of the point and then after-ward engage in eye contact with the physician or theparent, a child with an ASD may appear to be obliviousto the PCP’s gesture and verbal request. This is true evenif the PCP increases the intensity of the stimulus bycalling louder, adding the child’s name, or touching thechild’s shoulder ﬁrst and then pointing and exclaiming,“Look!” The child may still fail to respond even if theparent repeats the maneuvers. With an older, higher-functioning child, the PCP may enter into conversationwith the child to determine if he has difﬁculty interpret-
ing a ﬁgure of speech, telling a joke, or explaining whya joke is funny. In addition, the PCP may ask a questionor two about one of the child’s areas of interest toobserve a response that is characteristic of AS, such as along-winded, overly precise, or pedantic reply. Any ofthese responses should raise the concern of a PCP.
Each concern raised by a parent, other caregiver, or
the pediatrician constitutes a separate risk factor, as doesa positive family history of a sibling with an ASD ( Step 2 ).
To determine how to proceed, the pediatrician shouldassess the number of risk factors ( Step 3 ). Possible scores
include 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
1. If no concerns have been raised during the course of
the preventive visit and the child is not the sibling ofa child who has already been diagnosed with an ASD,then the PCP should proceed to Step 4 . ASD-speciﬁc
screening is indicated only if the visit is the 18- or24-month preventive visit. See Step 5c below.
2. If the child’s only risk factor is having a sibling with
an ASD, then the PCP should make sure the parentsare aware of early signs of ASDs and continue tomonitor carefully.
253If the parents call with a concern
between scheduled routine preventive visits, thechild should be seen within 1 or 2 weeks and reenterthe algorithm at Step 1b for a “targeted visit” to ad-
dress concerns about ASDs. If the score /H110051 as a result
of a single concern (parent, other caregiver, or PCP),the PCP should screen the child formally with a stan-dardized tool; the choice of tool will depend on thechild’s age ( Step 3a ) (see “Screening Tools for Imple-
mentation of Step 5 ”).
3. If 2 or more risk factors are identiﬁed, then the PCP
should proceed directly to Step 8 , which includes sev-
eral activities that should be accomplished simulta-neously and without delay.
Screening for ASDs ( Steps 5a–5c )
Physician estimates of the developmental status of chil-dren are much less accurate when only clinical impres-sions, rather than formal screening tools, are used,
256,257
yet a minority of PCPs use formal developmental screen-ing instruments,
258,259 and few pediatricians speciﬁcally
screen for ASDs.5A standardized screening tool should
be administered at any point when concerns about ASDsare raised spontaneously by a parent or as a result ofclinician observations or surveillance questions aboutsocial, communicative, and play behaviors ( Steps 5a and
5b).
246,260 In the general developmental screening and
surveillance policy statement discussed previously, theAAP also recommended administering a standardizedautism-speciﬁc screening tool on all children at the 18-month preventive care visit ( Step 5c ).
246The AAP Autism
Expert Panel responded to the statement with a com-

on 08 May 2023mentary260that suggested a repeat screening be per-
formed at 24 months of age ( Step 5c ) to identify those
who may regress after 18 months of age.
Screening Tools for Implementation of Step 5
A variety of general developmental screening tools areavailable to practitioners.
246General developmental
screening tools are appropriate for use with unselectedprimary care populations and are likely to detect ASDs inmany young children because of associated languageand cognitive delays, but they do not differentiate chil-dren with ASDs from those with other developmentaldisorders, and data are not available on sensitivity fordetection of ASDs. Tools to screen speciﬁcally for ASDsalso have been designed (Table 3), but they have not yetbeen validated on children younger than 18 months.The PCP should remember that screening tools are likelyto be overinclusive, so children with developmental andbehavioral disorders other than ASDs also might havepositive screening results. Similar to other developmen-tal screening measures, ASD-speciﬁc screening toolsmay rely entirely on parent report, or they may requiredirect observation and engagement by the clinician. Par-ent-report tools often have the advantage of being brief,inexpensive, and practical in the ofﬁce setting. The peo-ple who know the child best are surveyed and can de-scribe the child’s behavior over time in a variety ofsettings rather than being constrained to sampling be-havior in one setting at one point in time.
Step 5a : Tools for Use in “at-Risk” Children Younger Than
18 MonthsAlthough several tools are in development for screeningchildren younger than 18 months, none are available yetfor routine clinical use. The Infant/Toddler Checklistfrom the Communication and Symbolic Behavior ScalesDevelopmental Proﬁle
261(which can be downloaded at
www.brookespublishing.com/store/books/wetherby-cs-bsdp/CSBSDP /H14061Checklist.pdf) may be particularly well
suited for identifying 6- to 24-month-old children whoare at risk of ASDs, because it focuses on social andcommunication skills. It is anticipated that this and otherscreening tools under investigation as possible ASD-spe-ciﬁc tools for use in infants younger than 18 months mayprove valuable in identifying children at high risk and willbecome available to clinicians in the near future.
213,262,263
Step 5b : Tools for at-Risk Children 18 Months and Older
ASD-speciﬁc screening tools are available for children 18months and older, and many of them are age speciﬁc.Recently, such tools have been classiﬁed as “level 1” or“level 2” screening tools.
264Level 1 screening tools are
administered to all children within the context of aprimary care medical home and are designed to differ-entiate children who are at risk of ASDs from the generalpopulation, especially those with typical development.Level 2 screening tools are used more often in early
intervention programs or developmental clinics thatserve children with a variety of developmental prob-lems; they help to differentiate children who are at riskof ASDs from those at risk of other developmental dis-orders such as GDD or speciﬁc language impairment.Level 2 screening tools generally require more time andtraining to administer, score, and interpret than level 1measures. There is considerable overlap between theconcept of a level 2 screening tool and that of a diagnos-tic instrument.
264,265 Level 2 screening measures may be
used as part of a diagnostic evaluation, but they shouldnot be used in isolation to make a diagnosis.
Properties of some level 1 and 2 ASD screening tools
are reviewed in Table 3. Reported sensitivity and speci-ﬁcity values are included, but in most cases, sensitivityand speciﬁcity of the instruments have been determinedonly in clinical samples or in populations that included amixture of clinical and population-based samples, andthey must be interpreted with caution. Estimates of sen-sitivity and speciﬁcity of developmental screening testsmay be unstable, and they are not the only criteria thatshould be used to assess validity.
266In low-prevalence
conditions, such as ASDs, the positive predictive value ofscreening tools will be low even with good sensitivityand speciﬁcity, whereas the negative predictive valuewill be quite high. Many of the existing ASD-speciﬁcscreening measures are being revised or further evalu-ated, and new tools are being developed to address someof their weaknesses.
Some measures, such as the Checklist for Autism in
Toddlers (CHAT),
267Modiﬁed Checklist for Autism in
Toddlers (M-CHAT),268and Pervasive Developmental
Disorders Screening Test-II Primary Care Screener,269
were designed speciﬁcally for early detection of ASDs inyoung children. The CHAT and M-CHAT are level 1screening tools that are available at no cost to practitio-ners for use in primary care (Table 3).
For older children who are diagnosed later with AS,
school personnel often raise concerns to the parents.Staff may then administer a published AS-speciﬁc tool.Although many level 2 screening tools have been mar-keted for use in older children who have been identiﬁedas being at risk of AS, further study is needed before anyone of them can be recommended as superior to oth-ers.
270See Table 3 for characteristics of selected AS
screening tools.
Step 5c : Tools for Screening Children Without Risk Factors
at the 18- and 24-Month Preventive VisitLevel 1 ASD tools described in Step 5b also are appropri-
ate for routine screening of young children without anyidentiﬁed risk.
Among the tools designed for screening the elemen-
tary school–aged population, only the Childhood As-perger Syndrome Test (CAST) has been assessed in a

on 08 May 2023large, unselected population as a level 1 screening
tool.271The authors concluded that the CAST is useful as
a screening test for ASDs in epidemiologic research butthat there is not enough evidence to recommend it forroutine screening in the general population as part of apublic health program.
271In addition, the AAP does not
currently recommend universal screening of school-aged children with a level 1 AS-speciﬁc tool.
See Appendix 1 for reimbursement codes.
Results of Screening ( Steps 6a and6b)
If the screening result for an at-risk child is negative inStep 6a , the PCP should proceed to Step 7a , provide
parent educational materials (such as the AAP brochure,“Is Your One-Year-Old Communicating With You? ”
13or the
AAP parent booklet, “ Understanding Autism Spectrum Dis-
orders ”14) and schedule an extra visit ( Step 1b ) within 1
month to address residual concerns. If the only riskfactor is having a sibling with an ASD, an extra visit isnot necessary unless the parents become concerned afterthe visit. When the screening result is negative for chil-dren without risk at the 18- or 24-month preventivevisit ( Step 6b ), the PCP should proceed to Step 7b and
schedule the next routine preventive care visit ( Step 1a ).
If the screening result is positive ( Steps 6a or6b)o r2o r
more risk factors are present at Step 3 , the PCP should
proceed to Step 8 , at which simultaneous activities
should take place in an expedient manner. The PCPshould consider the possibility that the child with anegative ASD screening result may have another devel-opmental disorder that would warrant further investiga-tion and referral to resources similar to those listed inStep 8 .
When surveillance does not identify any risk factors
and the visit is not an 18- or 24-month visit ( Step 4 ), no
screening is recommended, and the PCP may proceeddirectly to Step 7b .
Step 8 : Activities Needed When Multiple Risk Factors Are
Present or When the ASD Screening Result Is PositiveActivities described herein will depend on certain com-munity characteristics, especially in regard to obtaining acomprehensive evaluation. Depending on the number ofASD experts in a given community, the interval wait foran appointment may be long. Thus, it is important thatthe PCP simultaneously accomplish all of Steps 8.1
through 8.4while the family is waiting for a specialty
appointment to conﬁrm or rule out an ASD diagnosis.
Step 8.1 : Provide Parental Education
If the PCP feels fairly certain that the child has a devel-opmental disorder that falls somewhere in the autismspectrum, it will be helpful to give the parents readingmaterials. As discussed in the introduction to this report,the AAP has published “ Understanding Autism Spectrum
Disorders ,” an educational booklet for parents with thisintent.
14The comprehensive evaluation will progress
more efﬁciently if the parents are more knowledgeableabout the characteristic clinical symptoms of ASDs andcan report them more accurately. Some PCPs are reti-cent to share their concerns with parents, fearful thatpremature “labeling,” although it is tentative, mightcause undo stress and anxiety on the part of the family.However, sincerity, honesty, and admitting uncertaintyis appreciated by most parents. On the other hand, con-cealing a concern and taking a “wait-and-see” approachrarely is appreciated; in fact, this strategy often breedsparental discontent and, worse, resentment and anger.With the recent high visibility in the media, most parents(unlike before the 1990s) now are aware of ASDs andmay suspect it and search the Internet for information. Itis important that they receive peer-reviewed and con-sensus-driven information that is evidence based andthat they understand how to interpret Web-site infor-mation that is not peer reviewed.
Step 8.2.a: ASD Comprehensive Evaluation
For some children, the diagnosis might be quite obviousto the PCP who is using the DSM-IV-TR criteria as aguide. In others, the diagnosis may be challenging, es-pecially when externalizing behavioral symptoms aremild or variable and/or there are associated comorbiddisorders. Ideally, the deﬁnitive diagnosis of an ASDshould be made by a team of child specialists with ex-pertise in ASDs. Unfortunately, teams are not availablein every locale, and when they are, long waiting listsmay exist. Most communities will have at least 1 pedi-atric subspecialist (eg, child neurologist, developmentalpediatrician, psychiatrist) with at least some expertise inmaking an ASD diagnosis. Other professionals, such aschild psychologists, SLPs, pediatric occupational thera-pists, and social workers with expertise in ASDs, can behelpful by performing independent evaluations, oftenusing standardized tools that can assist in the diagnosticprocess, especially when no team or pediatric “expert” isavailable. Child psychologists with appropriate trainingand experience can make the diagnosis independentlyand often do so, especially in school systems. Recently,the American Speech-Language-Hearing Associationpublished guidelines that stated that an SLP with exper-tise in ASDs can make the diagnosis independentlywhen other resources are not available.
294,295 Older chil-
dren who ﬁrst present with symptoms of AS after schoolentry often are ﬁrst recognized and evaluated by theschool district’s educational diagnostic team and subse-quently, but unfortunately not always, referred to ahealth care professional.
If it seems fairly certain, on the basis of general de-
velopmental screening and/or available psychometrictesting with standardized tools, that the child also hasGDD or intellectual disability, then the PCP might orderhigh-resolution karyotype and DNA testing for fragile X

on 08 May 2023syndrome. If the child has clinical features (history, fam-
ily history, physical examination) that are characteristicof a speciﬁc genetic or neurologic disorder that can beeasily conﬁrmed by a speciﬁc laboratory test, then thePCP may want to proceed with that test. On the otherhand, the PCP may opt to refer the child to pediatricsubspecialists for assistance with an etiologic workupand/or a search for coexisting conditions. Depending onavailability and the nature of the concern(s), the PCPshould consider a referral to a developmental pediatri-cian, a geneticist, and/or a child neurologist.
104,296 See the
next section for a more extensive discussion of the com-ponents of a comprehensive evaluation.
Step 8.2.b: Early Intervention/Early Childhood Education
ServicesAs soon as an infant or toddler is suspected of having adelay or being at risk of a delay or developmental disor-der such as an ASD, he should be referred immediatelyto an early intervention program (a government-subsi-dized public program designed to serve children withspecial needs and/or developmental delays from thetime the problem is identiﬁed until the third birthday). Ifthe child has had his third birthday, the referral shouldbe made to the special education department in the localschool. Among other professionals, assessment teamswill almost always include SLPs and occupational ther-apists who can develop appropriate intervention planswithout a categorical diagnosis. Intervention is impor-tant and often can be effective, even if it begins asgeneric speech therapy (ie, therapy that addresses mostforms of language delay) and general developmentalstrategies. This intervention plan can be revised later toa more speciﬁc ASD intervention protocol (such asteaching JA) once the diagnosis is made. Experiencedtherapists often recognize ASD symptomatology and usestrategies tailored to the child’s individual deﬁcits, evenwithout a deﬁnitive ASD diagnosis.
Step 8.2.c: Audiology Evaluation
All children with language delays, including those sus-pected of having ASDs, should undergo an audiologicevaluation, even if the neonatal screening result wasnormal. This testing may be challenging to accomplish,because children with ASDs often are uncooperative forbehavioral audiometry, the test most frequently usedwith toddlers. If the attempt is unsuccessful, an auditorybrainstem response or brainstem auditory evoked-re-sponse test can be ordered; it is likely that sedation willbe required. Sedation may be challenging, because somechildren with ASDs may respond paradoxically to seda-tives.Steps 8.3 and8.4: Schedule Follow-up Visit and Reenter
AlgorithmThe child should be scheduled for a targeted follow-upvisit within 1 month and reenter the algorithm at Step 1b
to determine the status of the aforementioned referralsand to discuss any additional parental concerns oncethey have had the opportunity to read and learn moreabout ASDs.
COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION (SEE STEP 8.2.a )
There are 3 major diagnostic challenges in the compre-hensive assessment of a child with a suspected ASD:determining the child’s overall level of functioning;making the categorical diagnosis of an ASD; and deter-mining the extent of the search for an associated etiol-ogy. To accomplish these 3 goals, a comprehensive eval-uation should include the following components
212,297,298 :
1. Health, developmental, and behavioral histories that
include at least a 3-generation family pedigree and areview of systems.
2. Physical examination including a thorough search for
dysmorphic features and neurologic abnormalitiesand a Wood’s lamp examination of the skin.
3. Developmental and/or psychometric evaluation (de-
pending on age/skill level) to determine the child’soverall level of functioning and whether a discrep-ancy between motor-adaptive problem-solving andsocial communication skills is evident.
299,300
4. Determination of the presence of a categorical DSM-
IV-TR diagnosis, preferably with standardized toolsthat operationalize the DSM criteria.
5. Assessment of the parents’ knowledge of ASDs, cop-
ing skills, and available resources and supports.
6. A laboratory investigation to search for a known eti-
ology or coexisting condition guided by informationobtained in Steps 1 through 5.
When appropriate, the evaluation should include in-
formation from multiple sources, because the child’sperformance may vary among settings and caregivers.Depending on level of comfort, the PCP may opt to referto an experienced pediatric subspecialist, such as aneurologist, geneticist, or developmental pediatrician, tofurther evaluate the child, especially when there is anabnormal neurologic ﬁnding, seizures, regression, dys-morphic features, and/or a complex family history.
Laboratory testing for children with ASDs (compo-
nent 6 above) is controversial. Newer technology hasbeen developed since publication of the 2001 AAP state-ment and technical report
1,2; however, some tests are not
yet clinically available. Various specialists hold differingopinions about the deﬁnition of a “positive yield,” de-ﬁned herein as a positive test result that indicates aknown autism-related etiology (eg, a positive result on

on 08 May 2023DNA testing for fragile X syndrome or a karyotype re-
vealing a mutation at 9q or 16p indicating tuberoussclerosis). They also promote varying clinical indicationsfor extensive molecular testing and neuroimaging whenthe clinical validity of a positive ﬁnding is yet unknownin many cases.
301Some investigators have reported a
positive yield when, in fact, the identiﬁed abnormalitywas nonspeciﬁc, did not relate to a known autism-re-lated etiology, and did not affect counseling and/or man-agement (eg, delayed myelinization on MRI).
302Medical
symptoms should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis;rather than reﬂect an etiology, an abnormal test resultmay indicate that a child with an ASD has a coexistingcondition (eg, a gastrointestinal disorder). Thus, an ab-normal laboratory test result does not necessarily indi-cate a positive yield but may, indeed, indicate a condi-tion that needs medical attention (see the AAP clinicalreport “Management of Children With Autism SpectrumDisorders”
303). Reporting it as a positive yield makes it
difﬁcult to translate research methodology into recom-mendations that will help the clinician in the care of anygiven patient.
The yield of an etiologic investigation may be more
highly correlated with the presence or absence of coex-isting GDD/MR (intellectual disability) rather than withan isolated ASD. In fact, the presence of autism in acohort of children with GDD/MR (intellectual disability)decreased the chance of a positive yield.
304Depending on
the population characteristics, speciﬁc test(s) studied,and the decision-making process by which they wereordered (ie, as a screening technique for all study pa-tients with ASDs versus a targeted test indicated by aspeciﬁc clinical ﬁnding), positive yields range from aslow as 0%
101,305,306 to as high as 25% to 40%,307–309 but
most yield rates fall between 2% and 10%.† It is difﬁcultto compare studies because of variability in the workups,analysis in terms of GDD/MR or other phenotypic vari-ables, and interpretation of positive test results (eg, de-layed myelinization on MRI) or symptoms (eg, gastro-intestinal) that are not deﬁnitively associated withASDs.
310
Although the original ASD-speciﬁc consensus guide-
lines published between 1999 and 20011,2,106,107 have
been helpful in guiding the etiology-search strategy inchildren with ASDs, the presence of coexisting GDD/MR(intellectual disability) in a cohort of children with ASD(especially severe GDD/MR or intellectual disability as-sociated with dysmorphic features) is more highly cor-related with a positive yield and a recognizable syn-drome.
108Thus, guidelines that address the etiologic
workup of children with GDD/MR104,296,311,312 also should
be considered when evaluating a child with both an ASDand GDD/MR but not necessarily a child with an isolatedASD.Among laboratory tests, high-resolution chromosome
analysis by G-banding and molecular testing for fragile Xsyndrome have the highest yield in determining etiologyin patients with ASDs.‡ Some investigators have sug-gested a battery of additional screening cytogenetic andmolecular studies for all patients with ASDs regardless ofgender, presence or absence of coexisting GDD/MR, dys-morphic features, or family history.
309However, current
data do not support extensive testing of all children withASDs in clinical settings. Published studies have begun toaddress some of the newer molecular genetic techniquesthat have revolutionized genetic testing by detectingmicrodeletions, duplications, and rearrangements notvisible with high-resolution chromosomal testing. Tar-geted FISH studies can be used to screen for deletions orduplications, such as those associated with chromo-somes 15q and 22q.
305,310 A relatively recent use of FISH
technology is genome-wide subtelomere screening,which detects clinically signiﬁcant abnormalities in 2.5%of individuals with unexplained GDD/MR.
313This tech-
nology can detect a wide variety of abnormalities, in-cluding some such as 22q13.3 deletion, that have beenreported in a subset of children with ASDs.
314,315 Several
studies that examined the yield of subtelomere FISHscreening in ASD failed to detect a single abnormality,which suggests that it may not be helpful in the routineevaluation of these patients.
89,305 However, additional
studies are needed. Comparative genomic hybridization-microarray analysis is a promising tool that may becomestandard of care in the future, but this technique has notbeen evaluated systematically in children with ASDs.
Screening neurologic tests also have been suggested—
for example, electroencephalography (EEG [routineand/or prolonged sleep studies]) for all children withASDs.
316Although nonspeciﬁc abnormalities have been
found in most children, the signiﬁcance of these abnor-malities is not clear, and additional research is needed todetermine if intervention is of any value. Thus, there isno evidence to support universal screening EEG withouta clinical indication.
317,318 An EEG should be considered
for children who demonstrate clinical signs that mightrepresent seizures and for children with clear languageregression. However, EEGs in children that demonstrate“classic autistic regression” between 12 and 24 monthsare often nonspeciﬁc and not helpful in the diagnosticprocess. Previously published guidelines contain clearrecommendations that screening MRIs on all childrenwho present with ASDs, including those with isolatedmacrocephaly, are not necessary.
106,107,194 Given the het-
erogeneity of ASDs, the likelihood of multiple etiologies,and the questionable clinical validity of an extensivebattery of screening tests on all children with ASDs,more evidence is needed before a battery of genetic andneurologic testing becomes standard of care.

on 08 May 2023Although for the individual patient, it is important to
differentiate an idiopathic ASD (with a recurrence rateof 5%–6% [range: 2%–8%]) from an ASD-associatedsyndrome that may have a higher or lower recurrencerate, there is no simple 1-size-ﬁts-all search strate-gy.
1,2,106,107,300 Instead, the search should be guided by
clinical judgment based on history (eg, health, birth,developmental, behavioral, family) and clinical presen-tation (eg, comorbid MR, regression, seizures, neurode-velopmental ﬁndings, dysmorphic features, comorbidmedical conditions). The importance of dysmorphic fea-tures and/or neurologic abnormalities in predicting apositive yield particularly has been emphasized.
108Fam-
ily characteristics (eg, insurance status, concern aboutthe child’s discomfort, or interest in pursuing a “no-stone-left-unturned” etiologic workup) also may affectparental decisions regarding the extent of the workup.Finally, the availability of technology, the need for andfeasibility of sedation, managed care cost/beneﬁt guide-lines, and physician motivation each may play a role.There are certainly many advantages to having a diag-nosis, including genetic counseling and provision of re-currence risks of known syndromes, the possibility of aspeciﬁc treatment strategy, counseling regarding thenatural history of a known disorder, anticipation of alater associated comorbid disorder, prevention of sec-ondary disorders, availability of prenatal diagnosis, ac-cess to public support systems, access to syndrome-spe-ciﬁc parent support groups, and, in some cases, thepsychological beneﬁts of knowing that empower parentsto move on and focus on habilitative interventions.
A “search strategy” might be conceptualized as con-
sisting of 3 levels.
1. Studies that should be considered for all young
children with ASDs (ie, an audiology evaluation; how-ever, school-based hearing screening may be adequatein the older child with AS and no signiﬁcant language orlearning deﬁcits).
2. Studies that should be considered in all children
with both an ASD and coexisting GDD/MR or intellec-tual disability (ie, high-resolution karyotype [650 bands]and DNA testing for fragile X syndrome). Although ahigh-resolution karyotype might reveal larger duplica-tions, some clinicians believe that FISH testing for 15qduplications also might be indicated.
92,93In the future, a
microarray analysis may replace high-resolution karyo-typing. A methyl CpG-binding protein 2 ( MECP2 ) anal-
ysis should be considered in females who present withregression and autistic features that are also consistentwith Rett syndrome.
310
3. Targeted studies (eg, EEG, metabolic studies, MRI)
should be considered when speciﬁc clinical ﬁndings areidentiﬁed by history or physical examination (eg, sei-zures, cyclic vomiting and lethargy associated with mildillnesses and/or unusual odors, hypopigmented mac-ules). Identiﬁcation of more subtle indicators and theircorresponding appropriate laboratory tests might be fa-
cilitated by referral to a geneticist, pediatric neurologist,and/or developmental pediatrician.
Ongoing multisite studies are investigating speciﬁc
test protocols. Such evaluations are not recommended asclinical standard of care at this time until analysis of thedata indicates which of the extended tests, if any, areindicated and for which ASD populations. These re-search protocols include many tests that are investiga-tional, have unknown medical validity, and currentlyare not available for clinical use. Some of these testsinclude functional neuroimaging, immunologic studies,metabolic testing, ﬁbroblast karyotypes, neuroligin genetesting, mitochondrial gene sequencing, genomic mi-croarrays, and identiﬁcation of endophenotypes.
90,319 Al-
though these tests may not be relevant in clinical prac-tice, they do have the potential to expand the fund ofknowledge about ASDs, reveal more speciﬁc ASD sub-types, and provide a better understanding of coexistingdisorders and future prognosis. As the fund of knowl-edge regarding genetic markers for ASDs expands andtechnology continues to become more sophisticated, theyield of these laboratory investigations may eventuallyprove to be useful in the routine clinical evaluation ofchildren with idiopathic ASDs. For now, the existingdichotomy regarding the extent of testing in researchversus clinical settings is challenging.
301Existing data do
not support routine application of any particular testbattery, nor do they suggest that tests currently underinvestigation be routinely performed on all children withASDs at this time.
Prognosis
Although prognosis is one of the parents’ most pressingconcerns at the time of diagnosis, it depends on manyfactors and usually cannot be predicted during earlychildhood, especially in children younger than 3 years.
320
Important early predictors include JA skills, functionalplay skills,
321cognitive abilities, and severity of ASD
symptoms.322–334 Recent studies have revealed that al-
though most children diagnosed with AD retain theirdiagnosis at 9 years of age,
208many, especially those with
PDD-NOS, improve, and a minority have optimal out-comes; that is, they have normal intelligence and func-tion reasonably well in mainstream classrooms withoutan aid but still exhibit residual clinical signs of socialawkwardness, restrictive interests, or mild, infrequentstereotypies. Some may show signs of ADHD, language-based learning disabilities, or other learning challen-ges.
8–11,217 Poorer outcomes are associated with lack of JA
by 4 years of age and lack of functional speech by 5 yearsof age,
7,217 MR, seizures (especially with onset during
adolescence), comorbid medical (eg, tuberous sclerosis)or psychiatric (eg, schizophrenia) disorders, and severeautistic symptoms, especially when associated with ex-treme “aloofness.” Factors associated with better out-

on 08 May 2023comes include early identiﬁcation resulting in early en-
rollment in appropriate intervention programs7,332 and
successful inclusion in regular educational and commu-nity settings with typically developing peers.
Adult outcomes seem to correlate better with level of
cognitive-adaptive functioning than with the severity ofautistic symptoms. People with normal intelligence/adaptive functioning and milder autistic symptoms gen-erally have the best outcomes, those with MR or intel-lectual disability and severe autistic symptoms have theworst outcomes within the continuum, and those withnormal cognitive-adaptive skills and severe autisticsymptoms generally do better than those with MR orintellectual disability and mild autistic symptoms,
328,333
which reafﬁrms the contribution of intelligence ratherthan degree of atypicality (autistic symptoms). However,within the subgroup of children with normal intelli-gence, the degree of atypicality then becomes more im-portant in determining prognosis. Many believe thatpeople with AS have better outcomes than those withother ASDs. This may be true, because by deﬁnition, allthose with AS have normal intelligence. One adult out-come study found that although those with AS tend tohave a greater likelihood of earning a college degreethan those with high-functioning autism/PDD-NOS, thecollege education did not signiﬁcantly affect employ-ment or marriage status.
331,334
Genetic CounselingGenetic counseling regarding recurrence risk in siblingsis important even when the etiologic evaluation is neg-ative, because the recurrence risk is approximately 5%to 6% (range: 2%–8%) in a family with 1 child with anidiopathic ASD.
67,68 The prevalence of abnormality in
siblings is even higher, perhaps 20%, when the broaderphenotype or milder constellation of similar social, com-munication, and behavioral abnormalities is consid-ered.
68If there are already 2 siblings with ASDs in a
family, it is likely that the recurrence risk for a strictlydeﬁned ASD in subsequent offspring is well above 8%and may approach 25%, but there is insufﬁcient evi-dence to be more precise.
68It is important to discuss the
recurrence risk promptly after diagnosis to provide par-ents with this information before they conceive anotherchild.
67When an etiology is determined, the recurrence
risk may be lower or higher than the risk in idiopathicASD, depending on the syndrome or condition identi-ﬁed, and prenatal diagnosis may be possible.
GUIDANCE FOR PEDIATRICIANS REGARDING THE
IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF CHILDREN WITH ASDsIn summary, most PCPs can expect to care for severalchildren with ASDs in the context of the medical home.
5
No two children with ASDs will be exactly alike; eachwill have his or her own constellation of diagnostic andmanagement challenges. The PCP has an important rolein the early identiﬁcation of children with ASDs. PCPs
should do the following:
1. Conduct surveillance at every well-child visit. Be a
good listener and recognize the early subtle red ﬂagsthat indicate the possibility of an ASD. Be especiallyvigilant for younger siblings of a child who has al-ready been diagnosed with an ASD.
253
2. Screen at 18246,260 and 24260months and any other
time when parents raise a concern about a possibleASD. Although no screening tool is perfect, chooseand become comfortable with at least 1 tool for eachage group and use it consistently. Before 18 monthsof age, screening tools that target social and commu-nication skills may be helpful in systematically look-ing for early signs of ASDs.
261
3. If an ASD-speciﬁc screening result is negative but
either the parents or the PCP remain somewhat con-cerned, then the PCP should schedule the child for anearly, targeted clinic visit to address these persistentconcerns.
4. Act on a positive screening result or when a child
demonstrates 2 or more risk factors. Do not take a“wait-and-see” approach. Depending on the age ofthe child, simultaneously refer for all 3: comprehen-sive ASD evaluation; early intervention/early child-hood education services; and an audiologic evalua-tion. Do not wait for a deﬁnitive diagnosis of an ASDto refer for developmental services; early interventioncan be beneﬁcial even if it targets the child’s uniquedeﬁcits. The intervention strategy can be modiﬁed ifneeded when the child is determined to have an ASD.
The science of ASDs is expanding rapidly. Newer tools
are under development and should become available toclinicians so that children can be screened and evaluatedmore efﬁciently and with greater accuracy in the future.

ical report, “Management of Children With AutismSpectrum Disorders,”

techniques and challenges in caring for children withASDs within the context of a pediatric medical home.

Management of Children With
Autism Spectrum Disorders
Scott M. Myers, MD, Chris Plauche ´ Johnson, MD, MEd, the Council on Children With Disabilities
ABSTRACT
Pediatricians have an important role not only in early recognition and evaluation
of autism spectrum disorders but also in chronic management of these disorders.The primary goals of treatment are to maximize the child’s ultimate functionalindependence and quality of life by minimizing the core autism spectrum disorderfeatures, facilitating development and learning, promoting socialization, reducingmaladaptive behaviors, and educating and supporting families. To assist pediatri-cians in educating families and guiding them toward empirically supported inter-ventions for their children, this report reviews the educational strategies andassociated therapies that are the primary treatments for children with autismspectrum disorders. Optimization of health care is likely to have a positive effect onhabilitative progress, functional outcome, and quality of life; therefore, importantissues, such as management of associated medical problems, pharmacologic andnonpharmacologic intervention for challenging behaviors or coexisting mentalhealth conditions, and use of complementary and alternative medical treatments,are also addressed.
INTRODUCTION
The term autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been used to include the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)

diagnostic categories autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and pervasive develop-mental disorder–not otherwise speciﬁed.
2Recent estimates of the prevalence of
ASDs are in the range of 6.5 to 6.6 per 1000, and pediatricians, therefore, are likelyto care for children and adolescents with these diagnoses.
3–5In the companion
document to this clinical report,2the American Academy of Pediatrics has sum-
marized pertinent background information on ASDs and emphasized the impor-tance of surveillance and screening as well as other potential physician roles in thediagnostic process. However, the role of the primary health care professionalextends beyond recognizing signs of ASDs, referring for diagnostic evaluation,conducting an etiologic investigation, providing genetic counseling, and educatingcaregivers about ASDs and includes ongoing care and management.
ASDs, similar to other neurodevelopmental disabilities, are generally not “cur-
able,” and chronic management is required. Although outcomes are variable andspeciﬁc behavioral characteristics change over time, most children with ASDsremain within the spectrum as adults and, regardless of their intellectual func-tioning, continue to experience problems with independent living, employment,social relationships, and mental health.

minimize the core features and associated deﬁcits, maximize functional indepen-www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/

Facilitating development and learning, promoting social-ization, reducing maladaptive behaviors, and educatingand supporting families can help accomplish these goals.Ideally, interventions should help mitigate the core fea-tures of ASDs, which include impairment in social reci-procity, deﬁcits in communication, and restricted, repet-itive behavioral repertoire.
Educational interventions, including behavioral strat-
egies and habilitative therapies, are the cornerstones ofmanagement of ASDs. These interventions address com-munication, social skills, daily-living skills, play and lei-sure skills, academic achievement, and maladaptive be-haviors.
Optimization of medical care is also likely to have a
positive impact on habilitative progress and quality oflife. In addition to routine preventive care and treatmentof acute illnesses, management of sleep dysfunction,coexisting challenging behaviors or psychiatric condi-tions, and associated medical problems, such as seizures,may be particularly important. Medications have notbeen proven to correct the core deﬁcits of ASDs and arenot the primary treatment. However, associated mal-adaptive behaviors or psychiatric comorbidities may in-terfere with educational progress, socialization, health orsafety, and quality of life. These behaviors may be ame-nable to psychopharmacologic intervention or, in somecases, treatment of underlying medical conditions thatare causing or exacerbating the behaviors. Effectivemedical management may allow a child with an ASD tobeneﬁt more optimally from educational interventions.
EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS
Education has been deﬁned as the fostering of acquisi-tion of skills and knowledge to assist a child to developindependence and personal responsibility; it encom-passes not only academic learning but also socialization,adaptive skills, communication, amelioration of interfer-ing behaviors, and generalization of abilities across mul-tiple environments.
9Physicians and other clinicians are
often in a position to guide families to empirically sup-ported practices and help them evaluate the appropri-ateness of the educational services that are being offered.
Comprehensive Programs for Young Children
In the last 2 decades, research and program developmentin the area of educational intervention have focusedlargely on very young children with ASDs because ofearlier identiﬁcation and evidence that early intensiveintervention may result in substantially better out-comes.
9,10Model early childhood educational programs
for children with ASDs have been described in thoroughreviews.
9,11,12 These model programs are often catego-
rized as behavior analytic, developmental, or structuredteaching on the basis of the primary philosophical ori-entation. Although the approaches have important dif-ferences, they also overlap. For example, contemporary
comprehensive behavioral curricula borrow from devel-opmental or cognitive approaches (such as addressingjoint attention, reciprocal imitation, symbolic play, andtheory of mind and using indirect language stimulationand contingent imitation techniques), and some devel-opmental models (eg, the Denver model) and the struc-tured teaching approach of the Treatment and Educationof Autistic and Related Communication HandicappedChildren (TEACCH) program use behavioral techniquesto fulﬁll their curriculum goals.
10,13
Although programs may differ in philosophy and rel-
ative emphasis on particular strategies, they share manycommon goals, and there is a growing consensus thatimportant principles and components of effective earlychildhood intervention for children with ASDs includethe following
9,10,14–16 :
●entry into intervention as soon as an ASD diagnosis is
seriously considered rather than deferring until a de-ﬁnitive diagnosis is made;
●provision of intensive intervention, with active en-
gagement of the child at least 25 hours per week, 12months per year, in systematically planned, develop-mentally appropriate educational activities designed toaddress identiﬁed objectives;
●low student-to-teacher ratio to allow sufﬁcient
amounts of 1-on-1 time and small-group instructionto meet speciﬁc individualized goals;
●inclusion of a family component (including parent
training as indicated);
●promotion of opportunities for interaction with typi-
cally developing peers to the extent that these oppor-tunities are helpful in addressing speciﬁed educationalgoals;
●ongoing measurement and documentation of the in-
dividual child’s progress toward educational objec-tives, resulting in adjustments in programming whenindicated;
●incorporation of a high degree of structure through
elements such as predictable routine, visual activityschedules, and clear physical boundaries to minimizedistractions;
●implementation of strategies to apply learned skills to
new environments and situations (generalization) andto maintain functional use of these skills; and
●use of assessment-based curricula that address:
●functional, spontaneous communication;
●social skills, including joint attention, imitation, re-
ciprocal interaction, initiation, and self-manage-ment;

on 08 May 2023●functional adaptive skills that prepare the child for
increased responsibility and independence;
●reduction of disruptive or maladaptive behavior by
using empirically supported strategies, includingfunctional assessment;
●cognitive skills, such as symbolic play and perspec-
tive taking; and
●traditional readiness skills and academic skills as de-
velopmentally indicated.
Speciﬁc Strategies
A variety of speciﬁc methodologies are used in educa-tional programs for children with ASDs. Detailed re-views of intervention strategies to enhance communica-tion,
9,17–20 teach social skills,21–24and reduce interfering
maladaptive behaviors21,25,26 have been published in re-
cent years. Brief descriptions of selected methodologiesare provided below.
Applied Behavior Analysis
Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the process of apply-ing interventions that are based on the principles oflearning derived from experimental psychology researchto systematically change behavior and to demonstratethat the interventions used are responsible for the ob-servable improvement in behavior. ABA methods areused to increase and maintain desirable adaptive behav-iors, reduce interfering maladaptive behaviors or narrowthe conditions under which they occur, teach new skills,and generalize behaviors to new environments or situ-ations. ABA focuses on the reliable measurement andobjective evaluation of observable behavior within rele-vant settings including the home, school, and commu-nity. The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention inASDs has been well documented through 5 decades ofresearch by using single-subject methodology
21,25,27,28 and
in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensivebehavioral intervention programs in university andcommunity settings.
29–40Children who receive early in-
tensive behavioral treatment have been shown to makesubstantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academicperformance, and adaptive behavior as well as somemeasures of social behavior, and their outcomes havebeen signiﬁcantly better than those of children in controlgroups.
31–40
Highly structured comprehensive early intervention
programs for children with ASDs, such as the YoungAutism Project developed by Lovaas
35,41at the University
of California Los Angeles, rely heavily on discrete trialtraining (DTT) methodology, but this is only one ofmany techniques used within the realm of ABA. DTTmethods are useful in establishing learning readiness byteaching foundation skills such as attention, compliance,imitation, and discrimination learning, as well as a vari-ety of other skills. However, DTT has been criticizedbecause of problems with generalization of learned be-
haviors to spontaneous use in natural environments andbecause the highly structured teaching environment isnot representative of natural adult-child interactions.Traditional ABA techniques have been modiﬁed to ad-dress these issues. Naturalistic behavioral interventions,such as incidental teaching and natural language para-digm/pivotal response training, may enhance generali-zation of skills.
13
Functional behavior analysis, or functional assess-
ment, is an important aspect of behaviorally based treat-ment of unwanted behaviors. Most problem behaviorsserve an adaptive function of some type and are rein-forced by their consequences, such as attainment of (1)adult attention, (2) a desired object, activity, or sensa-tion, or (3) escape from an undesired situation or de-mand. Functional assessment is a rigorous, empiricallybased method of gathering information that can be usedto maximize the effectiveness and efﬁciency of behav-ioral support interventions.
42It includes formulating a
clear description of the problem behavior (including fre-quency and intensity); identifying the antecedents, con-sequences, and other environmental factors that main-tain the behavior; developing hypotheses that specifythe motivating function of the behavior; and collectingdirect observational data to test the hypothesis. Func-tional analysis also is useful in identifying antecedentsand consequences that are associated with increasedfrequency of desirable behaviors so that they can be usedto evoke new adaptive behaviors.
Structured Teaching
The TEACCH method, developed by Schopler and col-leagues,
43emphasizes structure and has come to be
called “structured teaching.” Important elements ofstructured teaching include organization of the physicalenvironment, predictable sequence of activities, visualschedules, routines with ﬂexibility, structured work/ac-tivity systems, and visually structured activities.
43There
is an emphasis on both improving skills of individualswith ASDs and modifying the environment to accom-modate their deﬁcits. Several reports have documentedprogress in children who have received TEACCH ser-vices as well as parent satisfaction and improvement inparent teaching skills, but these reports were not fromcontrolled studies of treatment outcomes.
44–49In a con-
trolled trial, Ozonoff and Cathcart50found that children
treated with a TEACCH-based home program for 4months in addition to their local day treatment programsimproved signiﬁcantly more than children in the controlgroup who received local day treatment services only.
Developmental Models
Developmental models are based on use of developmen-tal theory to organize hypotheses regarding the funda-mental nature of ASDs and design approaches to address

on 08 May 2023the deﬁcits. The Denver model, for example, is based
largely on remediating key deﬁcits in imitation, emotionsharing, theory of mind, and social perception by usingplay, interpersonal relationships, and activities to fostersymbolic thought and teach the power of communica-tion.
12This program has shifted from a center-based
treatment unit to service delivery in homes and inclusiveschool environments. Several studies have demon-strated improvements in cognitive, motor, play, and so-cial skills beyond what would be expected on the basis ofinitial developmental rates in children who are treatedaccording to the Denver model, but controlled trials arelacking.

proach focuses on (1) “ﬂoor-time” play sessions andother strategies that are purported to enhance relation-ships and emotional and social interactions to facilitateemotional and cognitive growth and development and(2) therapies to remediate “biologically based processingcapacities,” such as auditory processing and language,motor planning and sequencing, sensory modulation,and visual-spatial processing. Published evidence of theefﬁcacy of the DIR model is limited to an unblindedreview of case records (with signiﬁcant methodologicﬂaws, including inadequate documentation of the inter-vention, comparison to a suboptimal control group, and
lack of documentation of treatment integrity and howoutcomes were assessed by informal procedures
55) and a
descriptive follow-up study of a small subset (8%) of theoriginal group of patients.
59RDI focuses on activities that
elicit interactive behaviors with the goal of engaging thechild in a social relationship so that he or she discoversthe value of positive interpersonal activity and becomesmore motivated to learn the skills necessary to sustainthese relationships.
56Some reviewers have praised the
face validity of this model, which targets the core im-pairment in social reciprocity. However, the evidence ofefﬁcacy of RDI is anecdotal; published empirical scien-tiﬁc research is lacking at this time. One study reportedbeneﬁcial effects of RT on young children with ASDs orother developmental disabilities.
58Parents were taught
to use RT strategies to encourage their children to ac-quire and use pivotal developmental behaviors (atten-tion, persistence, interest, initiation, cooperation, jointattention, and affect). Children in both groups improvedsigniﬁcantly on nonstandardized play-based measures ofcognition and communication and standardized parentratings of socioemotional functioning. Although a con-trol group was lacking and the potential role of concur-rent educational services was unclear, the improvementswere beyond what the authors expected from matura-
tional factors alone.
58
Speech and Language TherapyA variety of approaches have been reported to be effec-tive in producing gains in communication skills in chil-dren with ASDs.
9,17,20 Didactic and naturalistic behavioral
methodologies (eg, DTT, verbal behavior, natural lan-guage paradigm, pivotal response training, milieu teach-ing) have been studied most thoroughly, but there is alsosome empirical support for developmental-pragmaticapproaches (eg, Social Communication Emotional Reg-ulation Transactional Support, Denver model, RDI,Hanen model).
People with ASDs have deﬁcits in social communica-
tion, and treatment by a speech-language pathologistusually is appropriate. Most children with ASDs candevelop useful speech, and chronologic age, lack of typ-ical prerequisite skills, failure to beneﬁt from previouslanguage intervention, and lack of discrepancy betweenlanguage and IQ scores should not exclude a child fromreceiving speech-language services.
60However, tradi-
tional, low-intensity pull-out service delivery modelsoften are ineffective, and speech-language pathologistsare likely to be most effective when they train and workin close collaboration with teachers, support personnel,families, and the child’s peers to promote functionalcommunication in natural settings throughout the day.
60
The use of augmentative and alternative communi-
cation modalities, including gestures, sign language, andpicture communication programs, often is effective inenhancing communication.
17,20,61 The Picture Exchange
Communication System (PECS)62,63is used widely. The
PECS method incorporates ABA and developmental-pragmatic principles, and the child is taught to initiate apicture request and persist with the communication un-til the partner responds. Some nonverbal people withASDs may beneﬁt from the use of voice-output commu-nication aids, but published evidence for these aids isscant.
20,64Introduction of augmentative and alternative
communication systems to nonverbal children withASDs does not keep them from learning to talk, andthere is some evidence that they may be more stimu-lated to learn speech if they already understand some-thing about symbolic communication.
61,62,65
Social Skills InstructionThere is some objective evidence to support traditionaland newer naturalistic behavioral strategies and otherapproaches to teaching social skills.
22–24,66–68 Joint atten-
tion training may be especially beneﬁcial in young,preverbal children with ASDs, because joint attentionbehaviors precede and predict social language develop-ment.

strated that joint attention and symbolic play skills canbe taught and that these skills generalize to different

tion and other reciprocal social interaction experiencesthroughout the day in the child’s regular activities. Ex-amples of these techniques are described in the Ameri-can Academy of Pediatrics parent booklet “ Understanding
Autism Spectrum Disorders .”
72
A social skills curriculum should target responding to
the social overtures of other children and adults, initiat-ing social behavior, minimizing stereotyped persevera-tive behavior while using a ﬂexible and varied repertoireof responses, and self-managing new and establishedskills.
10Social skills groups, social stories, visual cueing,
social games, video modeling, scripts, peer-mediatedtechniques, and play and leisure curricula are supportedprimarily by descriptive and anecdotal literature, but thequantity and quality of research is increasing.
10,15,73 A
number of social skills curricula and guidelines are avail-able for use in school programs and at home.
10,66,74,75
Occupational Therapy and Sensory Integration TherapyTraditional occupational therapy often is provided topromote development of self-care skills (eg, dressing,manipulating fasteners, using utensils, personal hy-giene) and academic skills (eg, cutting with scissors,writing). Occupational therapists also may assist in pro-moting development of play skills, modifying classroommaterials and routines to improve attention and organi-zation, and providing prevocational training. However,research regarding the efﬁcacy of occupational therapyin ASDs is lacking. Sensory integration (SI) therapy of-ten is used alone or as part of a broader program ofoccupational therapy for children with ASDs. The goal ofSI therapy is not to teach speciﬁc skills or behaviors butto remediate deﬁcits in neurologic processing and inte-gration of sensory information to allow the child tointeract with the environment in a more adaptive fash-ion. Unusual sensory responses are common in childrenwith ASDs, but there is not good evidence that thesesymptoms differentiate ASDs from other developmentaldisorders, and the efﬁcacy of SI therapy has not beendemonstrated objectively.
76–78 Available studies are
plagued by methodologic limitations, but proponents ofSI note that higher-quality SI research is forthcoming.
79
“Sensory” activities may be helpful as part of an overallprogram that uses desired sensory experiences to calmthe child, reinforce a desired behavior, or help withtransitions between activities.
Comparative Efﬁcacy of Educational Interventions for Young
ChildrenAll treatments, including educational interventions,should be based on sound theoretical constructs, rigor-ous methodologies, and empirical studies of efﬁcacy.
15
Proponents of behavior analytic approaches have beenthe most active in using scientiﬁc methods to evaluatetheir work, and most studies of comprehensive treat-ment programs that meet minimal scientiﬁc standards
involve treatment of preschoolers using behavioral ap-proaches.
16,38However, there is still a need for additional
research, including large controlled studies with ran-domization and assessment of treatment ﬁdelity. Empir-ical scientiﬁc support for developmental models andother interventions is more limited, and well-controlledsystematic studies of efﬁcacy are needed.
Most educational programs available to young chil-
dren with ASDs are based in their communities, andoften, an “eclectic” treatment approach is used, whichdraws on a combination of methods including appliedbehavior analytic methods such as DTT; structuredteaching procedures; speech-language therapy, with orwithout picture communication or related augmentativeor alternative communication strategies; SI therapy; andtypical preschool activities. Three studies that comparedintensive ABA programs (25–40 hours/week) to equallyintensive eclectic approaches have suggested that ABAprograms were signiﬁcantly more effective.
31,32,34 An-
other study that involved children with ASDs and globaldevelopmental delay/mental retardation retrospectivelycompared a less intensive ABA program (mean: 12hours) to a comparably intensive eclectic approach andfound statistically signiﬁcant but clinically modest out-comes that favored those in the ABA group.
33Although
the groups of children were similar on key dependentmeasures before treatment began, these studies werelimited because of parent-determined rather than ran-dom assignment to treatment group. Additional studiesto evaluate and compare educational treatment ap-proaches are warranted.
Programs for Older Children and Adolescents
Some model programs provide programming through-out childhood and into adulthood.
11More commonly,
the focus of specialized programs is on early childhood,and published research evaluating comprehensive edu-cational programs for older children and adolescentswith ASDs is lacking. However, there is empirical sup-port for the use of certain educational strategies, partic-ularly those that are based on ABA, across all age groupsto increase and maintain desirable adaptive behaviors,reduce interfering maladaptive behaviors or narrow theconditions under which they occur, teach new skills, andgeneralize behaviors to new environments or situa-tions.
13,21,28
When children with ASDs move beyond preschool
and early elementary programs, educational interven-tion continues to involve assessment of existing skills,formulation of individualized goals and objectives, selec-tion and implementation of appropriate interventionstrategies and supports, assessment of progress, and ad-aptation of teaching strategies as necessary to enablestudents to acquire target skills. The focus on achievingsocial communication competence, emotional and be-

on 08 May 2023havioral regulation, and functional adaptive skills nec-
essary for independence continues. Educational pro-grams should be individualized to address the speciﬁcimpairments and needed supports while capitalizing onthe child’s assets rather than being based on a particulardiagnostic label.
Speciﬁc goals and objectives and the supports that are
required to achieve them are listed in a child’s individ-ualized education plan and should be the driving forcebehind decisions regarding the most appropriate, leastrestrictive classroom placement. Appropriate settingsmay range from self-contained special education class-rooms to full inclusion in regular classrooms. Often, amix of specialized and inclusive experience is appropri-ate. Even highly functioning students with ASDs oftenrequire accommodations and other supports such as pro-vision of explicit directions, modiﬁcation of classroomand homework assignments, organizational supports,access to a computer and word-processing software forwriting tasks, and social communication skills training.When a paraprofessional aide is assigned, it is importantthat there be an infrastructure of expertise and supportfor the child beyond the immediate presence of theaide.
80The speciﬁc duties of the aide should be outlined,
the strategies to be used should be deﬁned, and the aideshould receive adequate training.
In adolescence, the term “transition” is used to de-
scribe the movement from child-centered activities toadult-oriented activities. The major transitions are fromthe school environment to the workplace and fromhome to community living. In schools, transition-plan-ning activities may begin at as early as 14 years of age,and by 16 years of age, the individualized education planshould include an individualized transition plan. Theemphasis may shift from academic to vocational servicesand from remediating deﬁcits to fostering abilities. Avocational assessment is often conducted to evaluate theadolescent’s interests and strengths and to determine theservices and supports needed to promote independencein the workplace and in the community. Comprehensivetransition planning involves the student, parents, teach-ers, the medical home, and representatives from all con-cerned community agencies. Depending on the individ-ual’s cognitive level, social skills, health condition, workhabits, and behavioral challenges, preparation for com-petitive, supported, or sheltered employment is targeted.Regardless of the type of employment, attention to skilldevelopment should never stop. Skills necessary for in-dependent living should be taught to the degree possiblegiven the abilities of the person. Sexuality educationinstruction should be included, and there is a growingbody of literature that has addressed the topic.
81–83
MEDICAL MANAGEMENTChildren with ASDs have the same basic health careneeds as children without disabilities and beneﬁt fromthe same health-promotion and disease-prevention ac-
tivities, including immunizations. In addition, they mayhave unique health care needs that relate to underlyingetiologic conditions, such as fragile X syndrome or tu-berous sclerosis, or to other conditions, such as epilepsy,that often are associated with ASDs. Those with pica orpersistent mouthing of ﬁngers or objects should be mon-itored for elevated blood lead concentrations, particu-larly if the history suggests potential for environmentalexposure.
84These health care needs are most appropri-
ately met within the context of a medical home.85,86
To deliver appropriate and effective medical care, the
history, approach to the patient, physical evaluation,and treatment options must be considered in the contextof the patient’s ASD.
87,88Familiarizing the patient with
the ofﬁce setting and staff, allowing ample time whiletalking before touching the patient, allowing the child tomanipulate instruments and materials, keeping instruc-tions simple, using visual cues and supports, slowingdown the pace, exaggerating social cues, and havingfamily and/or familiar staff available may be helpful inreducing the obstacles to health care provision presentedby patients’ difﬁculties with social interaction, commu-nication, and accepting novelty.
88Often, more time is
required for outpatient appointments. In a nationallyrepresentative sample, it was found that children withASDs spent twice as much time with the physician peroutpatient visit compared with children in controlgroups.
89
Associated Morbidity and MortalityHealth care utilization and costs are substantially higherfor children and adolescents with ASDs compared withchildren without ASDs,
89–91and available data suggest
that mortality is increased as well (standardized mortal-ity ratio: 2.4–2.6).
92,93The increased mortality in ASDs is
thought to be largely, but not completely, accounted forby the increased mortality associated with mental retar-dation and epilepsy. Cases of suicide in higher-function-ing individuals have been reported.
6
SeizuresThe reported prevalence of epilepsy among people withASDs ranges from 11% to 39%.
94Comorbid severe
global developmental delay/mental retardation and mo-tor deﬁcits are associated with a high prevalence ofseizures (42%),
95whereas the prevalence of seizures is
only 6% to 8% in children with ASDs without severemental retardation, a motor deﬁcit, an associated etio-logic medical disorder, or a positive family history ofepilepsy.
95,96The prevalence of epilepsy also was higher
in studies that included adolescents and young adults,because the onset of epilepsy in ASDs has 2 peaks: 1before 5 years of age and another in adolescence.
97An-
ticonvulsant treatment in children with ASDs is based onthe same criteria that are used for other children with

on 08 May 2023epilepsy, including accurate diagnosis of the particular
seizure type.98
Epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalogra-
phy (EEG) are common in children with ASDs, withreported frequencies ranging from 10% to 72%.
99Some
studies have suggested that epileptiform abnormalitieson EEG
100and/or epilepsy101are more common in the
subgroup of children with ASDs who have a history ofregression, whereas other studies have not demon-strated this association.
102,103 Autistic regression with ep-
ileptiform abnormalities on EEG has been compared byanalogy with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and electricalstatus epilepticus in sleep, but there are important dif-ferences between these conditions, and the treatmentimplications are unclear.
94,104 Whether subclinical sei-
zures have adverse effects on language, cognition, andbehavior is debated, and there is no evidence-based rec-ommendation for the treatment of children with ASDsand epileptiform abnormalities on EEG, with or withoutregression.
104Universal screening of patients with ASDs
by EEG in the absence of a clinical indication is notcurrently supported.
2,99However, because of the in-
creased prevalence of seizures in this population, a highindex of clinical suspicion should be maintained, andEEG should be considered when there are clinical spellsthat might represent seizures.
Gastrointestinal Problems
The relationship between gastrointestinal problems andASDs is unclear, because most studies have not exam-ined representative groups of children with ASDs com-pared with appropriate controls.
105,106 Surveys published
in the gastroenterology literature have stated that gas-trointestinal problems, such as chronic constipation ordiarrhea, occur in 46% to 85% of children with ASDs.
107–109
Lower rates in the range of 17% to 24% have beenreported in other population-based studies,
110–112 and a
nested case-control study in the United Kingdom foundthat only 9% of children with ASDs and the same per-centage of controls had a history of gastrointestinal com-plaints.
113However, in a recent cross-sectional study that
used structured interviews and matched control groups,a lifetime history of gastrointestinal symptoms (includ-ing abnormal stool pattern, frequent constipation, fre-quent vomiting, and frequent abdominal pain) was elic-ited in 70% of the children with ASDs, compared with42% of the children with other developmental disabili-ties ( P/H11005.03) and 28% of the children without devel-
opmental disabilities ( P/H11021.001).
114
In children with ASDs undergoing endoscopy, who
may or may not be representative of the general popu-lation of children with ASDs, high rates of lymphoidnodular hyperplasia and, often, histologically subtleesophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, and colitis have beendescribed, and preliminary evidence suggests that someimmunohistochemical features may be unique to in-ﬂammation associated with ASDs.
105,115,116 The existing
literature does not support routine specialized gastroen-terological testing for asymptomatic children withASDs.
105However, if a child with an ASD presents with
symptoms such as chronic or recurrent abdominal pain,vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation, it is reasonable toevaluate the gastrointestinal tract. Occult gastrointesti-nal discomfort also should be considered in a child whopresents with a change in behavior, such as outbursts ofaggression or self-injury. Radiographic evidence of con-stipation has been found to be more common in childrenwith ASDs than in controls with abdominal pain (36%vs 10%),
117and effective management may provide
global beneﬁt.
Sleep Disturbance
Sleep problems are common in children and adolescentswith ASDs at all levels of cognitive functioning.
118–122
Sleep problems correlate with family distress and mayhave signiﬁcant effects on daytime functioning and qual-ity of life of children with ASDs.
123–125 In some cases,
there may be an identiﬁable etiology such as obstructivesleep apnea or gastroesophageal reﬂux; assessment andtreatment are guided by history and physical examina-tion. When there is not an identiﬁable medical cause,behavioral interventions including sleep-hygiene mea-sures, restriction of daytime sleep, positive bedtime rou-tines, and extinction procedures often are effective.
118,126–129
Relatively little empirical information is available re-
garding pharmacologic management of sleep problemsin children with ASDs or other developmental disabili-ties. Recommendations typically are based on case re-ports and open-label trials, extrapolation from the adultliterature, and expert consensus (Table 1).
128There is
some evidence of abnormality of melatonin regulation inchildren with ASDs,
125,130 and melatonin may be effective
for improving sleep onset in children with ASDs as wellas children with other developmental disabilities
131–134
and otherwise healthy children with sleep/wake disor-ders.
135A recent open-label study suggested that con-
trolled-release melatonin improved sleep in a group of25 children with ASDs and that treatment gains weremaintained at 1- and 2-year follow-up,
136but random-
ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies areneeded. Recently, a child and a young adult with ASDswith signiﬁcant insomnia were reported to have re-sponded well, with no apparent adverse effects, to open-label treatment with the high-afﬁnity melatonin recep-tor agonist ramelteon.
137Antihistamines, /H92512-agonists,
benzodiazepines, chloral hydrate, trazodone, and newernonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agents, such as zolpidemand zaleplon, sometimes are used to treat pediatric in-somnia.
128In some cases, other conditions or symptoms,
such as epilepsy, depression, anxiety, or aggressive out-bursts, warrant pharmacologic treatment, and an agentthat also may assist with sleep can be chosen.

In some cases, medical factorsmay cause or exacerbate maladaptive behaviors, andrecognition and treatment of medical conditions mayeliminate the need for psychopharmacologic agents. For
example, in the case of an acute onset or exacerbation ofaggressive or self-injurious behavior, a source of pain ordiscomfort may be identiﬁed and treated.

colitis, allergic rhinitis, and others. When behavioraldeterioration is temporally related to menstrual cycles inan adolescent female,
139use of an analgesic or oral or
injectable contraceptive may be helpful. Obstructivesleep apnea may contribute to behavioral deteriorationand may be amenable to weight reduction, tonsillectomyand adenoidectomy, or continuous positive airway pres-sure.
140Extreme food selectivity has the potential to lead
to protein-calorie malnutrition or speciﬁc vitamin ormineral deﬁciencies; however, most studies that evalu-ated nutritional status in children with ASDs have sug-gested that despite dietary selectivity, malnutrition isuncommon.
105,141 Although the prevalence in children
with ASDs is unknown, pica related to iron or zincdeﬁciency may respond to supplementation with theappropriate mineral. It should be noted that it is not clearhow frequently medical factors cause or exacerbate se-rious maladaptive behaviors in children with ASDs, andthe efﬁcacy of these interventions is based on anecdotes,case reports, and conventional clinical practice ratherthan empirical support from clinical trials.
It is also important to consider environmental factors
that may precipitate challenging behaviors. Parents,teachers, or other caregivers may inadvertently reinforcemaladaptive behaviors, and in such cases, the most ap-propriate and effective interventions are behavioral. Insome instances, a mismatch between educational or be-havioral expectations and cognitive ability of the child isresponsible for disruptive behavior (eg, when the diag-nosis of mental retardation has not been recognized),and adjustment of expectations is the most appropriateintervention. In both situations, a functional analysis ofbehavior, completed by a behavior specialist in the set-tings in which the problems occur, will identify factors inthe environment that exacerbate or maintain the prob-lematic behavior. A strategy for intervention throughbehavioral techniques and environmental manipula-
tions can then be formulated and tested.
Psychopharmacology
Pharmacologic interventions may be considered for mal-adaptive behaviors such as aggression, self-injurious be-havior, repetitive behaviors (eg, perseveration, obses-sions, compulsions, and stereotypic movements), sleepdisturbance, mood lability, irritability, anxiety, hyperac-tivity, inattention, destructive behavior, or other disrup-tive behaviors. After treatable medical causes and mod-iﬁable environmental factors have been ruled out, atherapeutic trial of medication may be considered if thebehavioral symptoms cause signiﬁcant impairment infunctioning and are suboptimally responsive to behav-ioral interventions. In some cases, the diagnosis of acomorbid disorder, such as major depression, bipolardisorder, or an anxiety disorder, can be made reasonablyand the patient can be treated with medications that areuseful for treating these conditions in otherwise typicallydeveloping children and adolescents. Modiﬁcations ofdiagnostic criteria may be necessary to account for clin-ical presentations of psychiatric conditions in individualswith developmental disabilities,
142,143 and tools such as
behavior checklists144and structured interviews145may
be helpful. In other cases, clinicians opt to target speciﬁcinterfering maladaptive behaviors or symptom clustersin the absence of a clear comorbid psychiatric diagnosis(a target-symptom approach).
146–151
Recent surveys indicate that approximately 45% of
children and adolescents152–154 and up to 75% of
adults8,155with ASDs are treated with psychotropic med-
ication. Greater age, lower adaptive skills and socialcompetence, and higher levels of challenging behaviorare associated with the likelihood of medication use.

on 08 May 2023tailed in recent reviews.148,150,151,156 Although most psych-
otropic medications have been used in children withASDs, there is currently insufﬁcient literature to estab-lish consensus regarding an evidence-based approach topharmacologic management. However, in recent years,there has been an increase in publication of randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to guideclinical practice.
Surveys performed in the United States suggest that
selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypicalantipsychotic agents, stimulants, and
/H92512-adrenergic ag-
onist antihypertensive agents are the most commonlyprescribed classes of psychotropic medications for chil-dren with ASDs.
152,153 Double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials have demonstrated efﬁcacy of the SSRIs ﬂuox-etine
157and ﬂuvoxamine158,159 in the treatment of repet-
itive and other maladaptive behaviors in patients withASDs, and open-label trials of these and other SSRIshave shown improvements in target symptoms, includ-ing repetitive behaviors, irritability, depressive symp-toms, tantrums, anxiety, aggression, difﬁculty with tran-sitions, and aspects of social interaction and language.
157–161
Potential adverse effects of SSRIs include but are notlimited to nausea, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction, con-stipation, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, headache, diz-ziness, dry mouth, agitation, behavioral activation, hy-pomania or mania, apathy, suicidal ideation, andalteration of sleep.
Risperidone has become the ﬁrst medication with US
Food and Drug Administration–approved labeling forthe symptomatic treatment of irritability (including ag-gressive behavior, deliberate self-injury, and temper tan-trums) in children and adolescents with ASDs. Twolarge, multisite, randomized, controlled trials have con-ﬁrmed the short-term efﬁcacy of risperidone for thesesevere disruptive behaviors in youth with ASDs,
162–165
and 2 open-label studies, each with a double-blind dis-continuation component, have suggested long-termbeneﬁts and tolerance.
166,167 Potential adverse effects in-
clude but are not limited to excessive appetite andweight gain, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperpro-lactinemia, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskine-sia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, QTc prolongation,dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, seizures, he-matologic abnormalities, and sedation.
Although early studies of the effects of stimulants
yielded negative results, recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of methylphenidate have demonstratedimprovement in hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inatten-tion in children with ASDs.
168–170 Methylphenidate is
effective in some children with ASDs, but the responserate is lower than that in children with isolated atten-tion-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, adverse effects aremore frequent, and it is unclear whether the results canbe generalized to other stimulants.
170,171 Potential ad-
verse effects of stimulant medications include but are notlimited to appetite reduction, inhibition of growth, de-
layed sleep onset, jitteriness, exacerbation of tics, ab-dominal discomfort, increased blood pressure, increasedheart rate, irritability, increased anxiety, and repetitivebehaviors.
Two small double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
have documented modest beneﬁts of clonidine in reduc-ing hyperarousal symptoms including hyperactivity,irritability and outbursts, impulsivity, and repetitive be-haviors in children with ASDs.
172,173 A prospective open-
label trial174and a retrospective record review175have
suggested that guanfacine was similarly effective in somepatients. Potential adverse effects of these centrally act-ing
/H92512-agonists include but are not limited to drowsiness,
sedation, dry mouth, decreased blood pressure, dizzi-ness, constipation, and irritability, and these drugs canbe dangerous in overdose. Recently, a retrospectivestudy,
176an open-label trial,177and a small double-blind,
placebo-controlled crossover trial178suggested that ato-
moxetine may be effective for attention-deﬁcit/hyperac-tivity disorder–like symptoms in children and adoles-cents with ASDs, and additional research is warranted.Appetite suppression, nausea, fatigue, mood swings, sui-cidal ideation, dizziness, and liver injury are among thepotential adverse effects of atomoxetine.
A summary of selected target symptoms, potential
psychiatric diagnoses, and medication options is pro-vided in Table 1. Pediatricians and other practitionersshould only prescribe medications with which they havesufﬁcient expertise, including knowledge of indicationsand contraindications, dosing, potential adverse effects,drug-drug interactions, and monitoring requirements. Itwill be important for future research to address the needfor more rigorous evaluation of safety and efﬁcacy ofpsychotropic agents in children with ASDs; the value ofcombining behavioral and medical interventions; thepractice of polypharmacy; delineation of clinical andbiological subgroups of patients who may be responsiveto particular treatments; the role of drugs in treatingdeﬁcits in language and nonlanguage cognition, socialinteraction, and behavioral rigidity; and the potential toalter the neural substrate during early critical periods toaffect brain development and future function. Severalmultisite trials are underway, and others undoubtedlywill be forthcoming.
179
Principles to guide the approach to psychopharmaco-
logic management of ASDs in clinical practice have beenproposed by several authors in recent years, and anapproach is outlined in Table 2.
148–151 When medications
are used, potential beneﬁts and adverse effects should beexplained, informed consent should be obtained, base-line data regarding behaviors and somatic complaintsshould be collected, and potential strategies for dealingwith treatment failure or partial response should bereviewed. It is important to have some quantiﬁablemeans of assessing the efﬁcacy of the medication and to

on 08 May 2023obtain input from a variety of sources, such as parents,
teachers, therapists, and aides. Consistent use of vali-dated, treatment-sensitive rating scales and medicationadverse-effect scales is desirable. A wide variety of out-come measures have been used in research trials and inclinical practice to measure maladaptive behavior treat-ment effects.
199Among the most common are the Clin-
ical Global Impression Scale, Aberrant Behavior Check-list, and Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form.
Complementary and Alternative Medicine
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is de-ﬁned by the National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine as “a group of diverse medical andhealth care systems, practices, and products that are notpresently considered to be part of conventional medi-cine.”
200The deﬁnition of CAM adopted by the CochraneCollaboration is “a broad domain of healing resources
that encompasses all health systems, modalities, andpractices and their accompanying theories and beliefs,other than those intrinsic to the politically dominanthealth systems of a particular society or culture in agiven historical period.”
201Detailed reviews of CAM as
related to developmental disabilities and ASD-speciﬁcCAM have been published recently.
202–204
Use of CAM is common in children with ASDs.152,205–207
Levy et al206reported that by the time their clinical
population received a formal diagnostic evaluation for asuspected ASD, almost one third of the children alreadyhad received a complementary or alternative therapy,and a survey conducted in a predominantly white, mid-dle-to-upper socioeconomic-status private-practice pop-ulation found that 92% of parents who responded hadused CAM therapies for their children with ASDs.

on 08 May 2023Another recent parent survey found that 52% of the
children with an ASD had been treated with at least 1CAM therapy, compared with 28% of a group of controlchildren without disabilities.
207Surveys indicate that
only 36% to 62% of caregivers who used CAM therapiesfor their children with ASDs had informed the child’sprimary care physician,
207,208 although more information
on CAM is something that families indicate that theywant from their child’s primary health care profession-als.
209
It is important that health care professionals under-
stand how to evaluate the evidence used to support alltreatments, including CAM, psychopharmacologic, andother interventions. Ideally, the evidence supporting orrefuting a treatment should include peer-reviewed stud-ies with appropriately diagnosed, well-deﬁned homoge-neous study populations; a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled design; an adequate sample size tosupport the statistical analysis presented; control for con-founding factors; and use of appropriate, validated out-come measures. When evaluating the efﬁcacy of studies,it is particularly important to keep in mind confoundingfactors, such as the placebo effect, and the natural his-tory of the disorder. Participation in a study may alterthe way a parent interacts with a child and confound theperceived outcome,
210and improvements are expected
with maturation and educational interventions. Onlyappropriately controlled studies are helpful in provingthat an effect is attributable to the intervention beingstudied.
The practitioner should encourage families to seek
additional information when they encounter the follow-ing claims or situations
211:
●treatments that are based on overly simpliﬁed scien-
tiﬁc theories;
●therapies that are claimed to be effective for multiple
different, unrelated conditions or symptoms;
●claims that children will respond dramatically and
some will be cured;
●use of case reports or anecdotal data rather than care-
fully designed studies to support claims for treatment;
●lack of peer-reviewed references or denial of the need
for controlled studies; or
●treatments that are said to have no potential or re-
ported adverse effects.
To help to describe their proposed rationales and
mechanisms, CAM therapies used to treat ASDs havebeen categorized as “nonbiological” or “biological.”
204
Examples of nonbiological interventions include treat-ments such as auditory integration training, behavioraloptometry, craniosacral manipulation, dolphin-assistedtherapy, music therapy, and facilitated communication.Examples of biological therapies include immunoregu-latory interventions (eg, dietary restriction of food aller-
gens or administration of immunoglobulin or antiviralagents), detoxiﬁcation therapies (eg, chelation), gastro-intestinal treatments (eg, digestive enzymes, antifungalagents, probiotics, “yeast-free diet,” gluten/casein-freediet, and vancomycin), and dietary supplement regi-mens that are purported to act by modulating neuro-transmission or through immune factors or epigeneticmechanisms (eg, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B
6and
magnesium, folic acid, folinic acid, vitamin B12, dimeth-
ylglycine and trimethylglycine, carnosine, omega-3 fattyacids, inositol, various minerals, and others).
203,204
For most of the aforementioned CAM interventions,
there is not enough scientiﬁc evidence yet to support orrefute their use as treatment for ASDs. However, evalu-ation of treatments is possible, and a few CAM treat-ments have been appropriately studied. For example,more than a dozen randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving more than 700 patients havedemonstrated that secretin (a biological treatment) is notan effective treatment for ASDs.
212,213 Evaluation of non-
biological treatments also is feasible. This has been dem-onstrated in the case of facilitated communication, atechnique that uses a trained facilitator to provide phys-ical support to a nonverbal person’s hand or arm whilethat person uses a computer keyboard or other device tospell. Evidence suggests that the communications pro-duced actually originate from the facilitator
214,215 and
that facilitated communication is not a valid treatmentfor ASDs.
216–218
Because of methodologic ﬂaws, insufﬁcient numbers
of patients, or lack of replication, many CAM therapieshave been inadequately evaluated; therefore, evidence-based recommendations for their use are not possible.The most recent and most appropriately designed trialshave demonstrated no signiﬁcant beneﬁt of dimethyl-glycine,
219,220 vitamin B6and magnesium,221,222 or audi-
tory integration training.223–225 Both positive226and neg-
ative227,228 results have been described for small,
methodologically ﬂawed studies of intravenous immu-noglobulin. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlledtrial revealed no statistically signiﬁcant differences onAberrant Behavior Checklist subscale scores betweensmall groups of children with ASDs who were givenomega-3 fatty acids and those who were given place-bo.
229However, the investigators noted a trend toward
superiority of omega-3 fatty acids over placebo for hy-peractivity, which suggests that further investigationmay be warranted.
229The gluten/casein-free diet is based
on a hypothesis of abnormal gut permeability and exog-enous opiate excess. Although use of the gluten/casein-free diet for children with ASDs is popular, there is littleevidence to support or refute this intervention, and re-viewers have determined that meaningful conclusionscannot be drawn from the existing literature.

sequent to these reviews, a randomized, double-blind

on 08 May 2023pilot study demonstrated no signiﬁcant beneﬁt.232Dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled elimination and challengestudies are in progress, and it is anticipated that thesestudies will provide substantially more useful informa-tion regarding the efﬁcacy of the gluten/casein-free di-et.
204,230 Measurement of urinary peptides has not been
proven to be clinically useful as a marker for ASDs or asa tool to determine if dietary restriction is warranted orwould be effective.
Many popular interventions, such as chelation of
heavy metals, antifungal agents to decrease presumedyeast overgrowth, and antiviral agents to modulate theimmune system, have not yet been studied in peoplewith ASDs; their popularity is based on unproven theo-ries and anecdotes or case reports. None of these inter-ventions can be endorsed as treatment for ASDs outsideof well-designed and appropriately monitored clinicaltrials. Some treatments, such as intravenous chelation,may be particularly dangerous and should be discour-aged. One child with autism died as a result of chelationwith edetate disodium (Na
2EDTA) despite the facts that
a causal association between mercury and ASDs has notbeen demonstrated, there is no scientiﬁc evidence thatchelation is an effective treatment for ASDs, and theeffectiveness of chelation therapy to improve nervoussystem symptoms of chronic mercury toxicity has notbeen established.
233Unless there is clear evidence of
current heavy metal toxicity, chelation by any method isnot indicated outside of monitored clinical trials.
In some cases, interesting ﬁndings await replication or
further investigation. For example, in a double-blind,placebo-controlled trial of vitamin C, improvement wasfound in total and sensory motor scores on the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale,
234and several small
studies have suggested that music therapy had someshort-term beneﬁt on communication skills but not onbehavior problems of children with ASDs.
235Recently, a
group of 20 children with ASDs were compared withchildren without ASDs and found to have an imbalanceof methionine and homocysteine metabolism, whichwas interpreted to represent impaired capacity for meth-ylation and increased oxidative stress.
236Treatment with
trimethylglycine, folinic acid, and methylcobalamin re-sulted in normalization of laboratory ﬁndings. The studydid not measure clinical response to the intervention,but anecdotal improvements were noted. Interpretationof these preliminary ﬁndings awaits further investiga-tion.
Health care practitioners who diagnose and treat chil-
dren with ASDs should recognize that many of theirpatients will use nonstandard therapies. The importanceof becoming knowledgeable about CAM therapies, in-quiring about current and past CAM use, providing bal-anced information and advice about treatment options,identifying risks or potential harmful effects, avoidingbecoming defensive or dismissing CAM in ways thatconvey a lack of sensitivity or concern, maintaining open
communication, and continuing to work with familieseven if there is disagreement about treatment choiceshas been emphasized.
237It also is essential to critically
evaluate the scientiﬁc merits of speciﬁc therapies andshare this information with families, educate familiesabout how to evaluate information and recognizepseudoscience, and insist that studies that examine CAMbe held to the same scientiﬁc and ethical standards as allclinical research.
202,238
Parents of children with ASDs will understandably
pursue interventions that they believe may present somehope of helping their child, particularly if the therapiesare viewed as being unlikely to have any adverse effects.Unfortunately, families are often exposed to unsubstan-tiated, pseudoscientiﬁc theories and related clinical prac-tices that are, at best, ineffective and, at worst, competewith validated treatments or lead to physical, emotional,or ﬁnancial harm. Time, effort, and ﬁnancial resourcesexpended on ineffective therapies can create an addi-tional burden on families. Health care professionals canhelp parents and other caregivers to distinguish empiri-cally validated treatment approaches from treatmentsthat have been proven to be ineffective and those thatare unproven and potentially ineffective and/or harm-ful.
FAMILY SUPPORT
Management should focus not only on the child but alsoon the family. Although parents once were viewed er-roneously as the cause of a child’s ASD, it is now recog-nized that parents play a key role in effective treatment.
9
Having a child with an ASD has a substantial effect on afamily. Parents and siblings of children with ASDs expe-rience more stress and depression than those of childrenwho are typically developing or even those who haveother disabilities.
239–243 Supporting the family and ensur-
ing its emotional and physical health is an extremelyimportant aspect of overall management of ASDs.
Physicians and other health care professionals can
provide support to parents by educating them aboutASDs; providing anticipatory guidance; training and in-volving them as cotherapists; assisting them in obtainingaccess to resources; providing emotional supportthrough traditional strategies such as empathetic listen-ing and talking through problems; and assisting them inadvocating for their child’s or sibling’s needs.
244In some
cases, referral of parents for counseling or other appro-priate mental health services may be required. The needfor support is longitudinal, although the speciﬁc needsmay vary throughout the family life cycle.
One of the chief strategies for helping families raise
children with ASDs is helping to provide them withaccess to needed ongoing supports and additional ser-vices during critical periods and/or crises. Natural sup-ports include spouses, extended family members, neigh-

on 08 May 2023bors, religious institutions, and friends who can help
with caregiving and who can provide psychological andemotional support. Informal supports include social net-works of other families of children with ASDs and com-munity agencies that provide training, respite, socialevents, and recreational activities. Formal supports in-clude publicly funded, state-administrated programssuch as early intervention, special education, vocationaland residential/living services, respite services, Medicaid,in-home and community-based waiver services, Supple-mental Security Income beneﬁts, and other ﬁnancialsubsidies. The breadth and depth of services vary, evenwithin the same state or region. Few services exist inmany rural areas, and public programs may have longwaiting lists.
Sibling support groups offer the opportunity to learn
important information and skills while sharing experi-ences and connecting with other siblings of childrenwith ASDs.
244Although the research on support groups
for siblings of children with disabilities is difﬁcult tointerpret because of study-design problems and incon-sistent outcome effects on sibling adjustment, thesegroups generally have been evaluated positively by partic-ipating siblings and parents,
244and there is some evidence
of beneﬁcial effects for siblings of children with ASDs.245
Because each state has organized its services and ac-
cess mechanisms differently, physicians and familiesmust learn their own state’s unique rules to access sup-ports by contacting the state or county ofﬁces of the
states’ Department of Health and Human Services orMental Health and Mental Retardation or the state de-velopmental disabilities organization. In addition, localparent advocacy organizations, national autism and re-lated developmental disability organizations, early inter-vention administrators, and school district special edu-cation coordinators often are knowledgeable aboutvarious programs and their respective eligibility require-ments.
CONCLUSIONS
ASDs are chronic conditions that affect nearly 1 of every150 children and require ongoing medical and nonmed-ical intervention. There is a growing body of evidencethat supports the efﬁcacy of certain interventions inameliorating symptoms and enhancing functioning, butmuch remains to be learned. In addition to their impor-tant roles in identifying ASDs through screening andsurveillance, establishing the diagnosis, conducting anetiologic evaluation, and providing genetic counselingafter a diagnosis is made,
2pediatricians and other pri-
mary health care professionals are in a position to pro-vide important longitudinal medical care and to supportand educate families and guide them to empirically sup-ported interventions for their children.COUNCIL ON CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,
